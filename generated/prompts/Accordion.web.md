# Generate: Accordion for React (web)

You are generating a production component for the **Design Schema** design system. The component schema below is the source of truth. Do not invent props, events, or styles that are not in it, and do not omit any that are.

## Output

Write `packages/react/src/Accordion.tsx` exporting a typed React function component named `Accordion`, plus `Accordion.stories.tsx` covering every enum value of every enum prop.

## Rules

- React 19: `ref` is a prop; no forwardRef; `useId`; Actions are not used by components. Type the component as `function Accordion({ ref, …rest }: AccordionProps & { ref?: Ref<HTMLElement> })` (the root element's type in place of `HTMLElement`) and attach `ref` to the root; generated ids come from `useId()`; never `useActionState`, `useFormStatus`, or a form `action` prop.
- Render the element and attributes declared under `platforms.web`. Map each event to its `platforms.web` name.
- Style ONLY through the CSS custom properties generated from tokens (`--color-…`, `--space-…`, `--font-…`, `--radius-…`). Never hard-code a color, size, or font. A style binding like `color.action.{variant}.background` becomes `var(--color-action-${variant}-background)`.
- Implement every item in `a11y.requires`:
  - `accessible-name`: the `label` prop is rendered as visible text or `aria-label`; never both empty.
  - `focus-visible`: a `:focus-visible` outline using `--color-border-focus` and `--border-width-focus`. Never remove the outline without replacing it.
  - `keyboard-operable`: native element semantics (do not build interactive elements from `<div>`).
  - `target-24px` / `target-44px`: `min-inline-size`/`min-block-size` from `--size-target-min` / `--size-target-comfortable`.
  - `heading-hierarchy`: render the heading level as the matching `<h1>`–`<h6>`; do not pick the element by visual size.
- `disabled` uses `aria-disabled="true"` and keeps the element focusable (WCAG-friendly) unless the schema says otherwise. On native checkable inputs (checkbox, radio, switch) `readOnly` has no effect, so guard with `preventDefault()` in both `click` and `change`.
- Visually hidden text (for accessible-name suffixes) uses the standard clip pattern — absolute, 1px box, `clip-path: inset(50%)`, `white-space: nowrap` — the one sanctioned use of pixel literals.
- Support light and dark by relying on the token variables only — no theme logic in the component.
- `disabled` uses `opacity.disabled`; transitions use `motion.duration.fast` + `motion.easing.standard` and are removed under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Use every `copy.*` string verbatim; do not write your own user-facing text.
- Testability hooks for the gates: the component root carries `data-ds="<Name>"`; a component with a `keyboard` block ships a story exported as `Keyboard` that renders it open/present with its trigger (if any) and at least three focusable children, no decorators that add other focusable elements.
- `keyboard` rules are the keyboard model: implement every key → action exactly as listed and nothing else; `composition` parts must render the named system component. Overlays: render into a portal at `document.body` (a `container` prop may override), lock body scroll while open, make the rest of the page `inert` for modal dialogs (`focus-trap` + `inert-background`), restore focus to the opener on close (`focus-restore`), position non-modal popups with `position: fixed` from the trigger's `getBoundingClientRect()` and flip when they would overflow the viewport, and put them on the right stacking layer with `z-index: var(--layer-<name>)`.
- Props of type `array`, `object`, or `function` carry a `shape` string in TypeScript notation; use it verbatim as the type. Prop type `content` is `ReactNode` / a slot / `ReactNode` by platform.
- Interpolated style bindings (`color.status.{tone}.background`) resolve per enum value at render time; never enumerate them by hand where a lookup will do. A resolved path ending in `.default` drops that segment (`color.background.{surface}` with `default` is `color.background`, i.e. `--color-background` / `colorBackground`); an enum value of `none` for a background/border/max-width binding renders nothing rather than a token.
- Composite components (Breadcrumb, Alert, RadioGroup) reuse the system's existing components (Link, Button, Text) from the same package rather than re-implementing them, and never restyle a child (no class overrides, no `::part`, no style props reaching into it): if a child needs a variation, the child's schema grows.
- Transitions use the component's own `transition` binding (its token and description), with `motion.easing.standard`; `motion.duration.fast` is only the default when a component has no `transition` binding.
- Development-only warnings the docs ask for use the platform convention: `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'` (React), `import.meta.env.DEV` (Lit), `__DEV__` (React Native).
- Stories are named after the prop and value in PascalCase (`ToneInfo`, `RoleBanner`); demo stories are titled `Demo/<Name>/<Platform>`.
- Icons: use the system `Icon` component for every glyph the docs name (`<Icon name="external" inline />`, `<ds-icon name="close">`, `<Icon name="check" color={…} />`); never draw an inline SVG or a Unicode glyph by hand. Decorative icons take no label; a glyph that carries meaning gets one.
- Enum props whose values are quoted digits (Heading `level`, Stack `gap`) accept both the string and the number.
- Stories: Storybook 10 CSF3 with `@storybook/react-vite`; title `'<Name>/React'`; one story per enum value plus Default.
- TypeScript 7 with `isolatedDeclarations`: every exported symbol carries an explicit type annotation and no export type is inferred — the component returns `ReactElement` (`ReactElement | null` when it can render nothing), exported constants, contexts and helpers are annotated, and `const meta: Meta<typeof Accordion> = …` in stories. `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` (`name?: T | undefined`), `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and `verbatimModuleSyntax` (`import type`) are on.
- Tests run on Vitest 5 over Vite 8 (jsdom, `@testing-library/react`); the behavior scenarios below become `Accordion.test.tsx`.
- Add a short JSDoc block that includes the "When to use" guidance verbatim.

## Declared contracts

The sections between the schema and the overrides resolve what the schema declares for web; a section is absent when the component declares none of it. Where one disagrees with prose or a rule above, the section wins.

- **Events**: call each handler under its emitted name with exactly the listed arguments, in order, and type `reason` as the union of its reasons. A `cancelable` event skips the default action when the handler returns `false` or calls `preventDefault()` on the event it receives. Fire only for the listed `fires` sources, in the `timing` order given.
- **Controlled state**: implement every pair: controlled when the prop is provided, uncontrolled from the default otherwise (local state), the event fired in both modes; a controlled component shows the new state only once the prop changes.
- **Parts and slots**: render each slot only under its resolved prop (`children` for the default slot). A composed part receives exactly the listed `props`, and each forward reaches the child's `overrides` under the child binding named; add no other.
- **Style bindings**: a binding styles its `part` (the `data-part` element), only in its `state` (`:hover`, `:focus-visible`, the ARIA state attribute), with the token listed for each `by` value; write `computed` as the given `calc()`. Never introduce a literal: the literal gate still applies.
- **Keyboard**: implement the listed rules as written and none the section excludes; `target` is the part that opens or closes, `repeat` the presses, and a `native` rule needs no code. A rule with `given` needs the `Keyboard` story to accept those args from the story URL shown.
- **Form and overlay**: a field registers through the one form contract `discovery` names, submitting `value` as `valueType` under `name` and running `validation` in order with the `messages` copy. An overlay anchors to `anchor`, reads `placement`, handles overflow by `collision`, dismisses exactly by `dismiss` through `closeEvent`, and is modal only when `modal` is true; this replaces the overlay defaults above.
- **Copy**: interpolate only the listed `params` and props; select a plural form with `new Intl.PluralRules(locale).select(count)`; never concatenate a count into a sentence.
- **Constants and examples**: logic reads each constant through its token expression, never the number it resolves to today. Every example is a story with the name shown and exactly its `given` as args.
- **Lifecycle**: a deprecated prop, event, value or component keeps working, carries a `@deprecated` JSDoc tag naming `use`, and warns once in development naming `use`.
- A `type: integer` prop accepts whole numbers only: type it `number` and never produce a fraction.

## Events

- `onChange`: emit `onChange`
  - payload, positional, in this order: `openIds: string[]`
  - fires on: user
- `onOpenChange`: emit `onOpenChange`
  - payload, positional, in this order: `id: string`, `open: boolean`, `reason: 'trigger' | 'keyboard' | 'exclusive' | 'controlled'`
  - reasons: `trigger` (the section trigger was activated by pointer); `keyboard` (the section was toggled from the keyboard — web and Lit pass through the activation method Disclosure reports on its own toggle, so the two reasons must not be collapsed there; React Native has no such signal and reports `trigger` for every activation); `exclusive` (another section opened and closed this one); `controlled` (the `value` prop changed to a set the accordion did not itself just emit)
  - fires on: user, controlled

## Controlled state

- `value` is controlled when given, uncontrolled from `defaultValue` when omitted; changes reported by `onChange` (emit `onChange`)

## Style bindings

- `itemGap`: token `layout.gap.none`; part `item`
- `triggerPaddingBlock`: token `space.md`; part `trigger`
- `triggerFontSize`: token `font.size.md`; part `trigger`
- `triggerFontWeight`: token `font.weight.medium`; part `trigger`

## Constants and examples

- example `faq`, story `Faq`: given `items: [{"id":"cancel","summary":"What happens if I cancel?","content":"You keep access until the end of the billing period."},{"id":"refunds","summary":"Do you offer refunds?","content":"Within 14 days of a charge, in full."}]`; A list of questions, several of which can be open at once.
- example `one-open-at-a-time`, story `OneOpenAtATime`: given `exclusive: true`, `items: [{"id":"free","summary":"Free","content":"One project and community support."},{"id":"pro","summary":"Pro","content":"Unlimited projects and email support."}]`; A comparison list where opening a section closes the rest.
- example `form-sections`, story `FormSections`: given `keepMounted: true`, `headingLevel: "2"`, `items: [{"id":"contact","summary":"Contact details","content":"Name and email fields."},{"id":"billing","summary":"Billing address","content":"Street and city fields."}]`; Form sections whose panels stay mounted so the Form still collects the fields inside.
- example `undivided`, story `Undivided`: given `divided: false`, `items: [{"id":"shipping","summary":"Shipping","content":"Orders ship within two business days."},{"id":"returns","summary":"Returns","content":"Items can be returned within 30 days."}]`; Sections without the hairline, for an accordion that already sits inside a Card.

## Overrides (per-instance styling contract)

Every style binding above becomes a CSS custom-property hook on the component root, named `--ds-<component>-<binding>` (kebab-case), defaulting to its token: `.ds-button {{ --ds-button-padding-inline: var(--space-md); padding-inline: var(--ds-button-padding-inline); }}`. Interpolated bindings set the hook per modifier class (`.ds-button--primary {{ --ds-button-background: var(--color-action-primary-background) }}`). Rules always read the hook, never the token directly.

The component accepts `overrides?: Partial<Record<OverridableBinding, TokenRef>>` where `OverridableBinding` is the union of the overridable bindings below and `TokenRef` is the token-name union exported by `@design-schema/tokens` (`import type {{ TokenRef }} from '@design-schema/tokens'`). Each entry sets the hook inline as `var(--<token-kebab>)`. Locked bindings are not in the type and are ignored if passed. Consumers may also set the hooks from their own CSS; that is the sanctioned escape hatch and the docs say so.

Overrides change values, never presence: a prop that turns a part off (`surface: none`, `border: false`, `radius: none`) makes the matching overrides no-ops; apply an override only where the binding is in effect.

Overridable: `divider`, `dividerWidth`, `itemGap`, `triggerPaddingBlock`, `fontFamily`, `triggerFontSize`, `triggerFontWeight`
Locked (accessibility-bearing, never overridable): `minTarget`, `focusRing`, `focusRingWidth`

## Behavior scenarios (8)

Each scenario below becomes one test. They are platform-neutral: `given` are prop overrides on the `Default` story's args, `when` is one interaction, `then` is a list of expectations. Scenarios marked `derived` were produced by the parser from the schema; the rest were written in the doc. Render every scenario; never skip one because the component does not satisfy it. A scenario the code fails is a failing test, and a scenario that cannot be expressed on this platform is a gap to report, not a test to delete.

## Guidance

## Overview

An accordion is a list of Disclosures that know about each other: consistent headings, arrow keys to move between them, and optionally the rule that opening one closes the rest. It is the right shape for FAQs, settings groups and long forms broken into sections.

## When to use

Use an Accordion for a series of independent sections a user scans by heading and opens selectively: an FAQ, a settings page grouped by topic, a multi-part form where each part is optional. Set `headingLevel` to fit the page outline. Leave `exclusive` off unless the panels are heavy or mutually exclusive by nature (a wizard-like "choose one plan to see details").

## When not to use

Do not use an Accordion for content most users need — show it. Do not use it as navigation or as tabs (Tabs replace content; an accordion adds it). Do not nest accordions. Do not use one for a single section; that is a Disclosure.

## Behavior

Each item is a Disclosure with a heading. Enter or Space toggles the focused item; with `exclusive`, opening one closes the others (closing does not open anything). Arrow keys, Home and End move focus among the triggers and wrap; Tab moves through triggers and open panel content in document order, since every trigger remains a tab stop. `onChange` receives the open ids. Disabled items are visible and skipped by arrows. `onOpenChange` reasons come from Disclosure's `onToggle(open, reason)`, so `keyboard` is distinguishable from `trigger` on web and Lit (native always reports `trigger`). With `exclusive` and several ids in `value`/`defaultValue`, the first is opened and a development warning notes the rest. Items are identified by `id` (on Lit, the slotted `<ds-disclosure>`'s `id` attribute). The `item` part is the composed Disclosure root itself — Accordion does not add a `data-part="item"` hook and must not wrap items in an extra element to carry one, since Dividers are direct siblings of the items; address an item as `[data-ds="Accordion"] > [data-ds="Disclosure"]`. The `trigger`, `triggerIcon` and `panel` parts are tagged by Disclosure. Nothing open is `[]` or `''`, never `undefined`. `reason: 'controlled'` is reported when `value` arrives holding a set the accordion did not itself just emit; a controlled parent that answers a trigger with some other set therefore sees `controlled`, which is the intended reading.

## Content guidelines

Summaries are section titles — noun phrases or questions in sentence case, parallel across the list. Panel content starts with the answer, not a restatement of the heading. For FAQs, order by frequency, not alphabetically.

## Accessibility

Each trigger is a button inside a heading of the given level with `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` (WCAG 4.1.2, 2.4.6; APG accordion), so the accordion reads as a list of headings in the rotor. Arrow keys are a convenience, not a replacement for Tab: every trigger is in the tab order so no panel content is stranded (2.1.1). Expanded state is visible (chevron) and announced. Targets meet 44px in the accordion form.

## Platform notes

### Web
Render `<div data-ds="Accordion">` containing a `Disclosure` per item with `headingLevel`, `keepMounted`, `open` controlled by the accordion's state, and `overrides={{ triggerPaddingBlock: 'space.md' }}`; a `Divider` between items when `divided`. Keydown on the container: when the event target is one of the triggers, handle ArrowUp/Down/Home/End by focusing the sibling trigger. `exclusive` maps each `onToggle` to the new open set.

### Lit
`<ds-accordion exclusive heading-level="3"><ds-disclosure summary="…">…</ds-disclosure>…</ds-accordion>`. On `slotchange`, set `heading-level`, `keep-mounted` and the padding override on each slotted `ds-disclosure`; listen for their composed `toggle` to enforce `exclusive` and dispatch `change`; handle arrow keys from bubbling keydown whose composed path includes a slotted trigger.

### React Native
`View` of `Disclosure`s with `Divider`s; the accordion owns the open set and passes `open`/`onToggle` to each. No arrow keys on native.
