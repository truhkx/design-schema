# Generate: Icon for React (web)

You are generating a production component for the **Design Schema** design system. The component schema below is the source of truth. Do not invent props, events, or styles that are not in it, and do not omit any that are.

## Output

Write `packages/react/src/Icon.tsx` exporting a typed React function component named `Icon`, plus `Icon.stories.tsx` covering every enum value of every enum prop.

## Rules

- React 19: `ref` is a prop; no forwardRef; `useId`; Actions are not used by components. Type the component as `function Icon({ ref, …rest }: IconProps & { ref?: Ref<HTMLElement> })` (the root element's type in place of `HTMLElement`) and attach `ref` to the root; generated ids come from `useId()`; never `useActionState`, `useFormStatus`, or a form `action` prop.
- Render the element and attributes declared under `platforms.web`. Map each event to its `platforms.web` name.
- Style ONLY through the CSS custom properties generated from tokens (`--color-…`, `--space-…`, `--font-…`, `--radius-…`). Never hard-code a color, size, or font. A style binding like `color.action.{variant}.background` becomes `var(--color-action-${variant}-background)`.
- Implement every item in `a11y.requires`:
  - `accessible-name`: the `label` prop is rendered as visible text or `aria-label`; never both empty.
  - `focus-visible`: a `:focus-visible` outline using `--color-border-focus` and `--border-width-focus`. Never remove the outline without replacing it.
  - `keyboard-operable`: native element semantics (do not build interactive elements from `<div>`).
  - `target-24px` / `target-44px`: `min-inline-size`/`min-block-size` from `--size-target-min` / `--size-target-comfortable`.
  - `heading-hierarchy`: render the heading level as the matching `<h1>`–`<h6>`; do not pick the element by visual size.
- `disabled` uses `aria-disabled="true"` and keeps the element focusable (WCAG-friendly) unless the schema says otherwise. On native checkable inputs (checkbox, radio, switch) `readOnly` has no effect, so guard with `preventDefault()` in both `click` and `change`.
- Visually hidden text (for accessible-name suffixes) uses the standard clip pattern — absolute, 1px box, `clip-path: inset(50%)`, `white-space: nowrap` — the one sanctioned use of pixel literals.
- Support light and dark by relying on the token variables only — no theme logic in the component.
- `disabled` uses `opacity.disabled`; transitions use `motion.duration.fast` + `motion.easing.standard` and are removed under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Use every `copy.*` string verbatim; do not write your own user-facing text.
- Testability hooks for the gates: the component root carries `data-ds="<Name>"`; a component with a `keyboard` block ships a story exported as `Keyboard` that renders it open/present with its trigger (if any) and at least three focusable children, no decorators that add other focusable elements.
- `keyboard` rules are the keyboard model: implement every key → action exactly as listed and nothing else; `composition` parts must render the named system component. Overlays: render into a portal at `document.body` (a `container` prop may override), lock body scroll while open, make the rest of the page `inert` for modal dialogs (`focus-trap` + `inert-background`), restore focus to the opener on close (`focus-restore`), position non-modal popups with `position: fixed` from the trigger's `getBoundingClientRect()` and flip when they would overflow the viewport, and put them on the right stacking layer with `z-index: var(--layer-<name>)`.
- Props of type `array`, `object`, or `function` carry a `shape` string in TypeScript notation; use it verbatim as the type. Prop type `content` is `ReactNode` / a slot / `ReactNode` by platform.
- Interpolated style bindings (`color.status.{tone}.background`) resolve per enum value at render time; never enumerate them by hand where a lookup will do. A resolved path ending in `.default` drops that segment (`color.background.{surface}` with `default` is `color.background`, i.e. `--color-background` / `colorBackground`); an enum value of `none` for a background/border/max-width binding renders nothing rather than a token.
- Composite components (Breadcrumb, Alert, RadioGroup) reuse the system's existing components (Link, Button, Text) from the same package rather than re-implementing them, and never restyle a child (no class overrides, no `::part`, no style props reaching into it): if a child needs a variation, the child's schema grows.
- Transitions use the component's own `transition` binding (its token and description), with `motion.easing.standard`; `motion.duration.fast` is only the default when a component has no `transition` binding.
- Development-only warnings the docs ask for use the platform convention: `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'` (React), `import.meta.env.DEV` (Lit), `__DEV__` (React Native).
- Stories are named after the prop and value in PascalCase (`ToneInfo`, `RoleBanner`); demo stories are titled `Demo/<Name>/<Platform>`.
- Icons: use the system `Icon` component for every glyph the docs name (`<Icon name="external" inline />`, `<ds-icon name="close">`, `<Icon name="check" color={…} />`); never draw an inline SVG or a Unicode glyph by hand. Decorative icons take no label; a glyph that carries meaning gets one.
- Enum props whose values are quoted digits (Heading `level`, Stack `gap`) accept both the string and the number.
- Stories: Storybook 10 CSF3 with `@storybook/react-vite`; title `'<Name>/React'`; one story per enum value plus Default.
- TypeScript 7 with `isolatedDeclarations`: every exported symbol carries an explicit type annotation and no export type is inferred — the component returns `ReactElement` (`ReactElement | null` when it can render nothing), exported constants, contexts and helpers are annotated, and `const meta: Meta<typeof Icon> = …` in stories. `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` (`name?: T | undefined`), `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and `verbatimModuleSyntax` (`import type`) are on.
- Tests run on Vitest 5 over Vite 8 (jsdom, `@testing-library/react`); the behavior scenarios below become `Icon.test.tsx`.
- Add a short JSDoc block that includes the "When to use" guidance verbatim.

```

## Overrides (per-instance styling contract)

Every style binding above becomes a CSS custom-property hook on the component root, named `--ds-<component>-<binding>` (kebab-case), defaulting to its token: `.ds-button {{ --ds-button-padding-inline: var(--space-md); padding-inline: var(--ds-button-padding-inline); }}`. Interpolated bindings set the hook per modifier class (`.ds-button--primary {{ --ds-button-background: var(--color-action-primary-background) }}`). Rules always read the hook, never the token directly.

The component accepts `overrides?: Partial<Record<OverridableBinding, TokenRef>>` where `OverridableBinding` is the union of the overridable bindings below and `TokenRef` is the token-name union exported by `@design-schema/tokens` (`import type {{ TokenRef }} from '@design-schema/tokens'`). Each entry sets the hook inline as `var(--<token-kebab>)`. Locked bindings are not in the type and are ignored if passed. Consumers may also set the hooks from their own CSS; that is the sanctioned escape hatch and the docs say so.

Overrides change values, never presence: a prop that turns a part off (`surface: none`, `border: false`, `radius: none`) makes the matching overrides no-ops; apply an override only where the binding is in effect.

Overridable: `size`, `color`
Locked (accessibility-bearing, never overridable): `strokeWidth`

## Behavior scenarios (33)

Each scenario below becomes one test. They are platform-neutral: `given` are prop overrides on the `Default` story's args, `when` is one interaction, `then` is a list of expectations. Scenarios marked `derived` were produced by the parser from the schema; the rest were written in the doc. Render every scenario; never skip one because the component does not satisfy it. A scenario the code fails is a failing test, and a scenario that cannot be expressed on this platform is a gap to report, not a test to delete.

## Guidance

## Overview

Icons are the one place Tier 1 had nothing to build from: every component drew its own check mark, chevron and status shape. Icon centralizes them. It is a primitive, not a design element in its own right: it has no tone of its own, takes its color from the text it sits in, and its size from the type scale, so a glyph beside a label always matches the label.

## When to use

Use an Icon wherever a component's anatomy names one: the leading icon in a Button, the chevron in a Disclosure, the status shape in an Alert, the check in a Checkbox, the external mark on a Link, the ellipsis in a collapsed Breadcrumb. Use `inline` when the icon is inside running text. Give it a `label` only when the icon is the whole message — a lone warning triangle in a table cell, say — and the label is what a screen reader should say instead.

## When not to use

Do not use an Icon as a button; wrap it in a Button with `iconOnly` and a `label`, which brings the target size, focus ring and accessible name. Do not use Icons as illustration or decoration at large sizes; that is an Illustration component (not planned) or an image. Do not add a glyph to the set for one screen; the set grows when a *component* needs a shape, and until then product code passes its own SVG to the slot that accepts content.

## Behavior

An Icon renders a single glyph at the requested size and does nothing else: no interaction, no focus, no animation. Its color is the surrounding text color on web and Lit (`currentColor`); on React Native the parent supplies it. Decorative icons (no `label`) are invisible to assistive technology so that "Save" is announced as "Save", not "check mark Save". Labelled icons are announced as images with their label.

## Content guidelines

Glyph geometry on the 16×16 grid, for glyphs with no existing path to reuse: `play` is a filled triangle (4,2)→(14,8)→(4,14); `pause` is two filled 3×12 bars at x=3 and x=10 from y=2; `folder` is an outlined shape from (2,4) to (14,13) whose top edge steps up to y=2 between x=2 and x=7 (the tab), a line glyph; `file` is an outlined rectangle from (4,2) to (12,14) with the top-right corner cut by a diagonal from (9,2) to (12,5) and that corner folded (a line from (9,2) down to (9,5) across to (12,5)), a line glyph; `list` is three horizontal lines from x=5 to x=14 at y=4, 8, 12 with a dot at x=2 on each; `grid` is four 5×5 outlined squares at (2,2), (9,2), (2,9), (9,9); `menu` is three horizontal lines from x=2 to x=14 at y=4, 8 and 12 (a line glyph). `calendar` is an outlined rectangle from (2,3) to (14,14) with a header rule at y=6 and two hanger ticks at x=5 and x=11 from y=1 to y=4, drawn as a line glyph. Glyph names describe the shape or the universal meaning, not the use ("chevron-down", "close", "warning"), so the same icon can serve many components. `dash` is the short indeterminate mark (4–12 on the grid) used by Checkbox; `minus` is the full-width line (3–13) that pairs with `plus`. `danger` is an octagon with an ×; Alert's current exclamation octagon changes to it when Alert is regenerated to compose Icon. A `label`, when used, says what the icon means in context ("Warning: over quota"), not what it depicts ("triangle").

## Accessibility

Decorative icons are hidden from assistive technology (WCAG 1.1.1: they carry no information the adjacent text does not). Meaningful icons expose role `img` and an accessible name from `label` (1.1.1, 4.1.2). Icons never convey information by color alone: the four status glyphs are four different shapes (1.4.1). Because they are drawn in the text color, they inherit whatever contrast the text has; components that place an icon on a tinted surface (Alert, Meter) declare that pair themselves. Line glyphs use the focus-ring width as their stroke so they stay legible at `xs` (1.4.11 applies only when the icon is meaningful, and a labelled icon then sits in a component that declares the pair).

## Platform notes

### Web
Export a `paths` table keyed by `name`, drawn on a 16×16 grid: line glyphs are bare `<path>`s inheriting the root's `fill="none" stroke="currentColor"`; the four status shapes and the ellipsis are single `fill="currentColor" stroke="none" fill-rule="evenodd"` paths whose inner mark is a hole. Render `<svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="1em" height="1em" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round">` with `stroke-width: var(--border-width-focus)` and `vector-effect: non-scaling-stroke` on paths in CSS. Size: `font-size: var(--font-size-{size})` on the element (attributes cannot take custom properties); `display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle`; with `inline`, `font-size: inherit; vertical-align: -0.125em`. Reuse the existing Disclosure/Link/Breadcrumb/Alert path data for chevrons, external, ellipsis and close so the later swap is visually neutral. Decorative: `aria-hidden="true"`; labelled: `role="img"` and `aria-label`. Always `focusable="false"`. Button, Link, Alert, Disclosure, Checkbox, RadioGroup and Breadcrumb should be updated to render `<Icon>` instead of their private glyphs in the next regeneration.

### Lit
`<ds-icon name="check" size="sm">` renders the same SVG in its shadow root; `:host { display: inline-flex; color: inherit }` and `:host([inline]) { display: inline-block; vertical-align: -0.125em; inline-size: 1em; block-size: 1em }`. Reflect `name`, `size` and `inline`. The paths table is a module-private constant; other elements compose `<ds-icon>`.

### React Native
Import `Svg` and `Path` from `react-native-svg` and render the shared `paths` table (export it from a `paths.ts` in the RN package, byte-identical to the web table so the swap stays visually neutral): `<Svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width={size} height={size} fill="none" stroke={color} strokeWidth={strokeWidth} strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round">` with `<Path d>` per glyph; filled glyphs pass `fill={color} stroke="none" fillRule="evenodd"`. `size` and `strokeWidth` come from the tokens through `useTheme()`. With `inline` nested in the system Text, size from the parent's font size via `TextNestingContext`; otherwise `font.size.md`. `color` from the prop, defaulting to `color.foreground`. Decorative: `accessibilityElementsHidden`, `importantForAccessibility="no"`; labelled: `accessibilityRole="image"`, `accessibilityLabel`. No Unicode fallback remains.
