# Generate: Divider for SwiftUI (iOS)

You are generating a production component for the **Design Schema** design system. The component schema below is the source of truth. Do not invent props, events, or styles that are not in it, and do not omit any that are.

## Output

Write `packages/swiftui/Sources/DesignSchema/Divider.swift` declaring `public struct Divider: View` with a public initializer whose parameters are the schema's props **in the schema's order** (doc defaults as default arguments), then the event closures in the schema's order, then `overrides:`; nested `public enum`s for enum props (`String` raw values equal to the doc values, case names the values camel-cased — `icon-only` → `iconOnly` — with leading digits moved to the end, `2xl` → `xl2`, since nothing else is a Swift identifier); `public struct`s for `array`/`object` shapes named from the shape; closures for events named per `platforms.swiftui`; and `#Preview` blocks. That order and those names are a contract: `tools/behavior_tests.ts` writes `Tests/DesignSchemaTests/Generated/DividerBehaviorTests.swift` from the doc's `behavior` block and calls this initializer directly. Beside it write `packages/swiftui/Sources/DesignSchema/Gallery+Divider.swift`: `public extension Gallery { static var <name>Screen: GalleryEntry { GalleryEntry("Divider") { … } } }`, one gallery screen showing the component in its states, where `<name>Screen` is the component name with a lower-case first letter. Never edit `Support/Gallery+Generated.swift` — the generator rewrites that list from the screen files.

## Rules

- Render the SwiftUI view declared under `platforms.swiftui.element` with the modifiers listed under `platforms.swiftui.props`. Map each event to its `platforms.swiftui` name.
- Read tokens from `@Environment(\.dsTheme)` (`DesignSchemaTokens`). Colors are `Color`, dimensions `CGFloat` points, durations `TimeInterval`, easings `Animation`, font weights `Font.Weight`, line heights unitless multipliers. Never hard-code a color, size, font or duration. A style binding like `color.action.{variant}.background` becomes a lookup keyed by the enum value.
- Implement every item in `a11y.requires` with SwiftUI's accessibility API:
  - `accessible-name`: `.accessibilityLabel(label)`; a visually hidden label is still the label.
  - `keyboard-operable` / `focus-visible`: `.focusable()` where the doc's keyboard table applies, `@FocusState` for the roving index, `.dsOnKeyPress` (the package's own wrapper around `.onKeyPress(keys:)`, so the behavior gate can reach the same handler) / `.onMoveCommand` / `.onExitCommand` for the keys, and the focus ring drawn from `focusRing`/`focusRingWidth` only for keyboard focus.
  - `target-24px` / `target-44px`: `.frame(minWidth: theme.sizeTargetMin, minHeight: …)` (or `sizeTargetComfortable`) plus `.contentShape(Rectangle())`.
  - `heading-hierarchy`: `.accessibilityAddTraits(.isHeader)`; `.accessibilityHeading(.h1…h6)` from the level prop.
  - `live-region`: `AccessibilityNotification.Announcement`.
  - `reduced-motion`: `@Environment(\.accessibilityReduceMotion)` disables every animation the doc names.
  - `selected-state` / `expanded-state`: `.isSelected` trait or `.accessibilityValue("expanded"/"collapsed")`.
  - `gesture-alternative`: every gesture has a visible control and an `.accessibilityAction`.
- `disabled` uses `opacity.disabled` on the whole element, `.accessibilityRespondsToUserInteraction(false)` and a press guard; never `.disabled(true)` unless the doc says the control leaves the focus order.
- `content` props are `@ViewBuilder` generic closures. Enum props whose values are quoted digits (Heading `level`, Stack `gap`) accept `Int` as well.
- Use every `copy.*` string verbatim through `String(localized:)`-ready constants; do not write your own user-facing text.
- Testability hooks: `.accessibilityIdentifier("Divider")` on the root and `"Divider.<part>"` on every anatomy part, names verbatim. The generated behavior tests find everything through them and assert against the accessibility tree, so a state the doc names has to be visible there: `expanded` as `.accessibilityValue("expanded")`/`("collapsed")`, `selected` as `.isSelected`, `disabled` as an element that reports itself not enabled.
- `keyboard` rules describe the web keyboard model; implement the subset an iPad hardware keyboard can reach and expose everything else through accessibility actions and visible controls. Overlays follow the conventions (sheet / fullScreenCover / popover / confirmationDialog / Menu).
- Props of type `array`, `object`, or `function` carry a `shape` string in TypeScript notation; translate it to a Swift `struct`/closure type with the same member names. `ReactNode` is a `@ViewBuilder` closure or `AnyView`.
- Interpolated style bindings (`color.status.{tone}.background`) resolve per enum value at render time; a resolved path ending in `.default` drops that segment; an enum value of `none` for a background/border/max-width binding renders nothing rather than a token.
- Composite components reuse the system's existing views (`Button`, `Link`, `Text`, `Heading`, `Icon`, `Stack`) from the package rather than re-implementing them, and never restyle a child: if a child needs a variation, the child's schema grows.
- Transitions use the component's own `transition` binding with `motion.easing.standard`; `motion.duration.fast` is only the default when a component has no `transition` binding.
- Development-only warnings use `#if DEBUG`.
- Previews are named after the prop and value in PascalCase (`ToneInfo`, `RoleBanner`).
- Icons: use `Icon(name:)` for every glyph the docs name; never draw a glyph inline and never use SF Symbols.
- Swift 6 strict concurrency: value-type views, `@MainActor` only around UIKit calls, no `@unchecked Sendable`.

## Declared contracts

The sections between the schema and the overrides resolve what the schema declares for swiftui; a section is absent when the component declares none of it. Where one disagrees with prose or a rule above, the section wins.

- **Events**: each closure takes exactly the listed arguments, in order, and `reason` is a nested `enum` of its reasons. A `cancelable` closure returns `Bool`, and `false` skips the default action. Fire only for the listed `fires` sources, in the `timing` order given.
- **Controlled state**: every pair becomes a `Binding<T>?` parameter plus the default's initial value, with `@State` holding the uncontrolled value; the closure fires in both modes, and a bound view shows the new state only once the binding changes.
- **Parts and slots**: each slot is a `@ViewBuilder` parameter under its resolved label only (`content` for the default slot). A composed part receives exactly the listed `props`, and each forward reaches the child's `overrides:` under the child binding named; add no other.
- **Style bindings**: a binding styles the view for its `part`, only in its `state` (`.onHover`, `@FocusState`, or the view's own state), with the token listed for each `by` value; write `computed` as the given multiplication of `theme` values. Never introduce a literal: the literal gate still applies.
- **Keyboard**: implement the listed rules as written and none the section excludes; `target` is the part that opens or closes, `repeat` the presses, and a `native` rule needs no code. A rule with `given` applies when those props are set.
- **Form and overlay**: a field registers through the one form contract `discovery` names, submitting `value` as `valueType` under `name` and running `validation` in order with the `messages` copy. An overlay anchors to `anchor`, reads `placement`, dismisses exactly by `dismiss` through `closeEvent`, and is modal only when `modal` is true; this picks among the conventions' overlay forms.
- **Copy**: interpolate only the listed `params` and props; select plural forms through `String(localized:)` with the entry's forms as its plural variations; never concatenate a count into a sentence.
- **Constants and examples**: logic reads each constant through its token expression, never the number it resolves to today. Every example becomes a `#Preview` with the name shown and exactly its `given`.
- **Lifecycle**: a deprecated parameter, closure, case or view keeps working, is marked `@available(*, deprecated, message:)` naming `use`, and warns once under `#if DEBUG` naming `use`.
- A `type: integer` prop is an `Int`: whole numbers only.

        either — a vertical divider is semantic only when `semantic` says so. An empty
        string is no label: the divider stays decorative and nothing warns. The development
        warning fires when the ignored combination appears or changes (an effect keyed
        on `label` and `orientation`), not on every render; on React Native a vertical
        divider with an ignored label and `semantic: true` gets both warnings. When

        pointing at the Text id (from useId) — separator children are presentational,
        so containment alone does not name it. Unlabelled, the root paints itself
        and is the `line` part; it carries no data-part. The line is a background-color

        root renders line segment, label Text, line segment, the segments aria-hidden.
        role, aria-orientation and aria-hidden are plain host attributes, not ElementInternals,
        because tests read them (dom-accessibility-api ignores internals). A labelled

## Parts and slots

- `line`: element
- `label`: component `Text`; props `size` = "sm", `tone` = "muted", `element` = "span"; forwards `labelSize` → `overrides.fontSize`, `fontFamily` → `overrides.fontFamily`

## Style bindings

- `labelColor`: token `color.foreground.muted`; part `label`; locked
- `labelSize`: token `font.size.sm`; part `label`
- `labelGap`: token `layout.gap.normal`; part `label`
- `fontFamily`: token `font.family.body`; part `label`

## Constants and examples

- example `or-between-alternatives`, story `OrBetweenAlternatives`: given `label: "or"`, `spacing: "normal"`; A labelled divider between two ways of signing in.
- example `list-furniture`, story `ListFurniture`: given `orientation: "horizontal"`; The default line between rows of a dense list - decorative, and silent to assistive technology.
- example `toolbar-groups`, story `ToolbarGroups`: given `orientation: "vertical"`; A vertical line between groups of toolbar controls, stretching to the row height; shown inside a horizontal Stack with align stretch so the row has a height to fill.
- example `section-boundary`, story `SectionBoundary`: given `semantic: true`, `spacing: "loose"`; An unlabelled line that still marks a real boundary a screen-reader user should hear.

## Overrides (per-instance styling contract)

The component accepts `overrides: [Binding: TokenRef] = [:]` where `Binding` is a nested `public enum Binding: String, CaseIterable` listing the overridable bindings below and `TokenRef` is the token-name enum generated into `DesignSchemaTokens`. Resolve each entry with `theme[ref]` and use the typed result in place of the binding's default token. This is the ONLY per-instance styling surface: there is no style modifier parameter, so a screen cannot drift from the system by passing points. Locked bindings are not cases of `Binding`.

Overrides change values, never presence: a prop that turns a part off (`surface: none`, `border: false`, `radius: none`) makes the matching overrides no-ops; apply an override only where the binding is in effect.

Overridable: `color`, `thickness`, `spacing`, `labelSize`, `labelGap`, `fontFamily`
Locked (accessibility-bearing, never overridable): `labelColor`

## Platform notes (swiftui)

```yaml
element: Rectangle
props:
- Rectangle
- .frame=height-1
- .accessibilityHidden
- .accessibilityElement
- .accessibilityLabel
notes: "A `Rectangle` of the color token, `border.width.thin` thick along the cross\
  \ axis (`.frame(height:)` horizontal, `.frame(width:)` vertical), `.accessibilityHidden(true)`\
  \ when decorative. With `label` the divider is an `HStack` of line\u2013`Text`\u2013\
  line and is an accessibility element with that label (VoiceOver reads it as a section\
  \ break); the label Text takes `fontSize` through `overrides`. Not SwiftUI's `Divider`\
  \ (fixed color)."
```

## Guidance

## Overview

A divider is a line, and the question it always raises is whether the line means something. Between two rows of a list it is furniture: it helps the eye and says nothing. Between "Today" and "Earlier" it is structure a screen-reader user should hear. Divider makes that choice explicit instead of leaving it to whether someone remembered `aria-hidden`.

## When to use

Use a Divider between items in a dense list where whitespace alone does not separate them, between groups in a menu (Menu renders its own), between toolbar groups (`vertical`), and with a `label` as an "or" between alternatives (sign in with email — or — with a provider) or a date heading in a feed. Use `spacing` when the divider stands outside a Stack.

## When not to use

Do not use dividers between page sections; use `section` spacing and headings — a page full of rules is a page without rhythm. Do not use a divider under a heading as decoration. Do not use a labelled divider as a heading substitute; if the label introduces content, it is a Heading. Do not rely on a divider alone to separate interactive regions.

## Behavior

Renders a one-token-thick line in the border color along the chosen axis, with optional symmetric spacing. With `label`, the text is centered with a line on each side and the divider becomes semantic. Nothing is interactive.

## Content guidelines

Labels are one to three words, sentence case or lowercase for conjunctions ("or"), no punctuation. Date and group labels match the headings elsewhere on the screen.

## Accessibility

Decorative dividers are hidden from assistive technology so lists do not announce "separator" between every row (WCAG 1.3.1 — structure is conveyed by the list, not the line). Semantic dividers expose role `separator` with `aria-orientation`, and labelled ones take the label as their accessible name (separator children are presentational, so the name is set explicitly: `aria-labelledby` on web, `aria-label` on Lit) with the flanking line pieces hidden. The line is below the 3:1 non-text threshold on purpose — it is not required to identify anything (1.4.11 exemption), and the label, when present, meets 4.5:1.

## Platform notes

### Web
Decorative: `<hr aria-hidden="true" class="ds-divider">`. Semantic: `<div role="separator" aria-orientation={orientation}>` with, for a label, two aria-hidden flex-grow line spans around a `Text size="sm" tone="muted"` that names the separator through `aria-labelledby`. Vertical uses `inline-size: var(--border-width-thin); align-self: stretch`.

### Lit
`<ds-divider>`; `<ds-divider semantic label="or">`. Host carries the styles and, when semantic, plain `role="separator"` and `aria-orientation` attributes (plus `aria-label` with a label); decorative hosts get `aria-hidden="true"`. The label renders in the shadow root.

### React Native
`View` with `height: t.borderWidthThin, backgroundColor: t.colorBorder` (or width for vertical, `alignSelf: 'stretch'`). Decorative: hidden from AT. Labelled: a row of two hidden lines with a `Text size="sm" tone="muted"` between; the text is what gets read.
