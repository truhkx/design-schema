# Generate: ActionSheet for React (web)

You are generating a production component for the **Design Schema** design system. The component schema below is the source of truth. Do not invent props, events, or styles that are not in it, and do not omit any that are.

## Output

Write `packages/react/src/ActionSheet.tsx` exporting a typed React function component named `ActionSheet`, plus `ActionSheet.stories.tsx` covering every enum value of every enum prop.

## Rules

- React 19: `ref` is a prop; no forwardRef; `useId`; Actions are not used by components. Type the component as `function ActionSheet({ ref, …rest }: ActionSheetProps & { ref?: Ref<HTMLElement> })` (the root element's type in place of `HTMLElement`) and attach `ref` to the root; generated ids come from `useId()`; never `useActionState`, `useFormStatus`, or a form `action` prop.
- Render the element and attributes declared under `platforms.web`. Map each event to its `platforms.web` name.
- Style ONLY through the CSS custom properties generated from tokens (`--color-…`, `--space-…`, `--font-…`, `--radius-…`). Never hard-code a color, size, or font. A style binding like `color.action.{variant}.background` becomes `var(--color-action-${variant}-background)`.
- Implement every item in `a11y.requires`:
  - `accessible-name`: the `label` prop is rendered as visible text or `aria-label`; never both empty.
  - `focus-visible`: a `:focus-visible` outline using `--color-border-focus` and `--border-width-focus`. Never remove the outline without replacing it.
  - `keyboard-operable`: native element semantics (do not build interactive elements from `<div>`).
  - `target-24px` / `target-44px`: `min-inline-size`/`min-block-size` from `--size-target-min` / `--size-target-comfortable`.
  - `heading-hierarchy`: render the heading level as the matching `<h1>`–`<h6>`; do not pick the element by visual size.
- `disabled` uses `aria-disabled="true"` and keeps the element focusable (WCAG-friendly) unless the schema says otherwise. On native checkable inputs (checkbox, radio, switch) `readOnly` has no effect, so guard with `preventDefault()` in both `click` and `change`.
- Visually hidden text (for accessible-name suffixes) uses the standard clip pattern — absolute, 1px box, `clip-path: inset(50%)`, `white-space: nowrap` — the one sanctioned use of pixel literals.
- Support light and dark by relying on the token variables only — no theme logic in the component.
- `disabled` uses `opacity.disabled`; transitions use `motion.duration.fast` + `motion.easing.standard` and are removed under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Use every `copy.*` string verbatim; do not write your own user-facing text.
- Testability hooks for the gates: the component root carries `data-ds="<Name>"`; a component with a `keyboard` block ships a story exported as `Keyboard` that renders it open/present with its trigger (if any) and at least three focusable children, no decorators that add other focusable elements.
- `keyboard` rules are the keyboard model: implement every key → action exactly as listed and nothing else; `composition` parts must render the named system component. Overlays: render into a portal at `document.body` (a `container` prop may override), lock body scroll while open, make the rest of the page `inert` for modal dialogs (`focus-trap` + `inert-background`), restore focus to the opener on close (`focus-restore`), position non-modal popups with `position: fixed` from the trigger's `getBoundingClientRect()` and flip when they would overflow the viewport, and put them on the right stacking layer with `z-index: var(--layer-<name>)`.
- Props of type `array`, `object`, or `function` carry a `shape` string in TypeScript notation; use it verbatim as the type. Prop type `content` is `ReactNode` / a slot / `ReactNode` by platform.
- Interpolated style bindings (`color.status.{tone}.background`) resolve per enum value at render time; never enumerate them by hand where a lookup will do. A resolved path ending in `.default` drops that segment (`color.background.{surface}` with `default` is `color.background`, i.e. `--color-background` / `colorBackground`); an enum value of `none` for a background/border/max-width binding renders nothing rather than a token.
- Composite components (Breadcrumb, Alert, RadioGroup) reuse the system's existing components (Link, Button, Text) from the same package rather than re-implementing them, and never restyle a child (no class overrides, no `::part`, no style props reaching into it): if a child needs a variation, the child's schema grows.
- Transitions use the component's own `transition` binding (its token and description), with `motion.easing.standard`; `motion.duration.fast` is only the default when a component has no `transition` binding.
- Development-only warnings the docs ask for use the platform convention: `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'` (React), `import.meta.env.DEV` (Lit), `__DEV__` (React Native).
- Stories are named after the prop and value in PascalCase (`ToneInfo`, `RoleBanner`); demo stories are titled `Demo/<Name>/<Platform>`.
- Icons: use the system `Icon` component for every glyph the docs name (`<Icon name="external" inline />`, `<ds-icon name="close">`, `<Icon name="check" color={…} />`); never draw an inline SVG or a Unicode glyph by hand. Decorative icons take no label; a glyph that carries meaning gets one.
- Enum props whose values are quoted digits (Heading `level`, Stack `gap`) accept both the string and the number.
- Stories: Storybook 10 CSF3 with `@storybook/react-vite`; title `'<Name>/React'`; one story per enum value plus Default.
- TypeScript 7 with `isolatedDeclarations`: every exported symbol carries an explicit type annotation and no export type is inferred — the component returns `ReactElement` (`ReactElement | null` when it can render nothing), exported constants, contexts and helpers are annotated, and `const meta: Meta<typeof ActionSheet> = …` in stories. `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` (`name?: T | undefined`), `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and `verbatimModuleSyntax` (`import type`) are on.
- Tests run on Vitest 5 over Vite 8 (jsdom, `@testing-library/react`); the behavior scenarios below become `ActionSheet.test.tsx`.
- Add a short JSDoc block that includes the "When to use" guidance verbatim.

```

## Overrides (per-instance styling contract)

Every style binding above becomes a CSS custom-property hook on the component root, named `--ds-<component>-<binding>` (kebab-case), defaulting to its token: `.ds-button {{ --ds-button-padding-inline: var(--space-md); padding-inline: var(--ds-button-padding-inline); }}`. Interpolated bindings set the hook per modifier class (`.ds-button--primary {{ --ds-button-background: var(--color-action-primary-background) }}`). Rules always read the hook, never the token directly.

The component accepts `overrides?: Partial<Record<OverridableBinding, TokenRef>>` where `OverridableBinding` is the union of the overridable bindings below and `TokenRef` is the token-name union exported by `@design-schema/tokens` (`import type {{ TokenRef }} from '@design-schema/tokens'`). Each entry sets the hook inline as `var(--<token-kebab>)`. Locked bindings are not in the type and are ignored if passed. Consumers may also set the hooks from their own CSS; that is the sanctioned escape hatch and the docs say so.

Overrides change values, never presence: a prop that turns a part off (`surface: none`, `border: false`, `radius: none`) makes the matching overrides no-ops; apply an override only where the binding is in effect.

Overridable: `scrim`, `shadow`, `radius`, `itemPaddingBlock`, `itemPaddingInline`, `itemGap`, `headerPaddingBlock`, `titleSize`, `fontFamily`, `fontSize`, `lineHeight`, `divider`, `dividerWidth`, `maxWidth`, `layer`, `enter`, `exit`
Locked (accessibility-bearing, never overridable): `surface`, `itemHover`, `itemColor`, `itemDangerColor`, `titleColor`, `minTarget`, `focusRing`, `focusRingWidth`

## Behavior scenarios (2)

Each scenario below becomes one test. They are platform-neutral: `given` are prop overrides on the `Default` story's args, `when` is one interaction, `then` is a list of expectations. Scenarios marked `derived` were produced by the parser from the schema; the rest were written in the doc. Render every scenario; never skip one because the component does not satisfy it. A scenario the code fails is a failing test, and a scenario that cannot be expressed on this platform is a gap to report, not a test to delete.

```yaml
- name: renders
  then:
  - renders: true
  derived: true
- name: has-accessible-name
  then:
  - name: true
  derived: true
```

## Platform notes (web)

  Cancel <ds-button>. Above maxWidth: renders Menu anchored to the element that was
  focused when `open` became true. Roving tabindex over the items; first item focused
  on open.'
```

## Guidance

## Overview

An action sheet answers "what can I do with this?" — the long-press or overflow menu of mobile. It lists a handful of verbs, groups the dangerous one at the bottom, and adds an explicit Cancel because thumbs miss. On wide screens the same list is a Menu next to what was clicked.

## When to use

Use an ActionSheet for contextual actions on an item — share, rename, duplicate, delete — opened from an overflow Button (`iconOnly`, label "More actions") or a long-press. Keep it to what fits without scrolling; more than eight actions means the item needs its own screen. Put destructive actions last with `tone: danger`.

## When not to use

Do not use it for navigation (Menu in a nav Landmark, or Links), for settings with state (a screen of Switches), for choosing a value (Select or RadioGroup in a BottomSheet), or for confirming — an ActionSheet's danger row opens an AlertDialog, it does not itself confirm. Do not put forms in it.

## Behavior

Opening presents the list with focus on the first action; arrow keys move between actions, Enter or Space chooses and fires `onAction(id)`, Escape, the scrim, the Cancel row, or a drag close it with `onClose`. Disabled actions are shown, skipped by arrow navigation, and announced as disabled. On wide screens the sheet becomes a Menu anchored to the opener: same actions, same events, no Cancel row (clicking outside closes). Focus returns to the opener on close in both presentations. On phones the sheet has BottomSheet''s handle and header, and the drag-to-dismiss gesture lives on them (the same 25% / 1.5 px/ms rule). Above the breakpoint it renders Menu with `anchor` set to the element that was focused when `open` became true (Menu renders no trigger in that mode), and maps Menu''s onOpenChange reasons to its own: `escape` → escape, `outside` → scrim, `action` → nothing (onAction fires instead).

## Content guidelines

Actions are verbs, one or two words, sentence case ("Rename", "Move to folder"). The title is the item's name, not "Options". Danger actions say what they destroy ("Delete photo"). Cancel is "Cancel".

## Accessibility

The list is a `menu` of `menuitem`s with an accessible name (WCAG 4.1.2, APG menu button). One tab stop; arrows move (roving-tabindex, arrow-navigation). Escape closes and focus returns to the opener (2.4.3). On phones the sheet is modal (inert background, focus trap) and every row meets 44px. The drag gesture is additive to Cancel and Escape (2.5.1). Danger rows are distinguished by color *and* position and an icon when given, never color alone (1.4.1). Contrast is checked for normal, danger and muted text on the surface and for the hover row.

## Platform notes

### Web
Below the breakpoint, reuse BottomSheet's `<dialog>` mechanics with `height: content`, a `<p>` title (muted, small), `<div role="menu" aria-label={heading ?? copy.defaultLabel}>` of `<button role="menuitem" tabindex={roving}>` rows (icon via `<Icon>`, label, `aria-disabled` for disabled), a divider before the danger group, and a separate Cancel `<Button variant="secondary">` under a divider. Above the breakpoint, render `<Menu>` with the same `actions`, anchored to `document.activeElement` at open time.

### Lit
`<ds-action-sheet open heading="Photo.jpg" .actions=${[...]}>`; shadow `<dialog>` or `<ds-menu>` by `matchMedia`; composed `action` and `close`.

### React Native
`Modal` sheet with `View accessibilityRole="menu"` of `Pressable accessibilityRole="menuitem"` rows (`accessibilityState={{ disabled }}`), a divider and a Cancel `Button`; drag-to-dismiss on the header via `PanResponder`; `onRequestClose` → `onClose('escape')`. On tablets above the breakpoint, `Menu`.
