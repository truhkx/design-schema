# Generate: Divider as a Lit web component

You are generating a production component for the **Design Schema** design system. The component schema below is the source of truth. Do not invent props, events, or styles that are not in it, and do not omit any that are.

## Output

Write `packages/lit/src/Divider.ts` defining the custom element tag declared under `platforms.lit.tag` (a `LitElement` subclass), exporting the class and registering it with `customElements.define`. Add a `Divider.stories.ts` covering every enum value of every enum prop.

## Rules

- Lit 3.3 with standard (TC39) decorators: each schema prop becomes a `@property()` auto-accessor — `@property({ type: String, reflect: true }) accessor variant: DividerVariant = 'primary'` — never a plain decorated field (`experimentalDecorators` is off). Props listed under `platforms.lit.reflect` use `reflect: true` so they can be styled from outside with attribute selectors. Boolean props are boolean attributes (`type: Boolean`). Internal state is `@state() private accessor open = false`.
- Each event is dispatched as a `CustomEvent` named by its `platforms.lit` value with `bubbles: true, composed: true` so it crosses the shadow boundary.
- Styles live in `static override styles: CSSResult = css\`…\`` and read ONLY token custom properties (`var(--color-…)`), which inherit through the shadow root. Never hard-code a color, size, or font. A style binding like `color.action.{variant}.background` becomes an attribute selector per enum value, e.g. `:host([variant="primary"]) { background: var(--color-action-primary-background); }`.
- Implement every item in `a11y.requires` inside the shadow DOM using a native element (e.g. a real `<button>`), and use `delegatesFocus: true` in `static override shadowRootOptions: ShadowRootInit` so focusing the host focuses the inner element.
- `accessible-name`: forward `label` to visible text or `aria-label` on the inner element.
- `focus-visible`: style `:focus-visible` on the inner element with `--color-border-focus` / `--border-width-focus`.
- `heading-hierarchy`: render the matching `<h1>`–`<h6>` inside the shadow root based on the level prop.
- Support light and dark by relying on token variables only.
- Form ownership is DOM-tree based: slotted light-DOM children are not owned by a `<form>` inside a shadow root. Follow the platform notes for how ds-form and ds-input cooperate by `name`.
- Events named like native events (`focus`, `blur`) are the native retargeted events — do not dispatch a CustomEvent with the same name.
- `disabled` uses `opacity.disabled`; transitions use `motion.duration.fast` + `motion.easing.standard`, removed under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Use every `copy.*` string verbatim; do not write your own user-facing text.
- Testability hooks for the gates: the host carries `data-ds="<Name>"`; a component with a `keyboard` block ships a story exported as `Keyboard` that renders it open/present with its trigger (if any) and at least three focusable children.
- `keyboard` rules are the keyboard model: implement every key → action exactly as listed and nothing else; `composition` parts must render the named system element. Overlays: a modal dialog uses a native `<dialog>` inside the shadow root opened with `showModal()` (native focus trap, `inert` background and top layer); non-modal popups use the Popover API (`popover="manual"`, `showPopover()`) when available and a `position: fixed` fallback, positioned from the trigger and flipped at the viewport edge; body scroll is locked while a modal is open; focus returns to the opener on close; stacking uses `z-index: var(--layer-<name>)` inside the top layer.
- Props of type `array`, `object`, or `function` carry a `shape` string in TypeScript notation; use it verbatim as the type. Prop type `content` is `ReactNode` / a slot / `ReactNode` by platform.
- Interpolated style bindings (`color.status.{tone}.background`) resolve per enum value at render time; never enumerate them by hand where a lookup will do. A resolved path ending in `.default` drops that segment (`color.background.{surface}` with `default` is `color.background`, i.e. `--color-background` / `colorBackground`); an enum value of `none` for a background/border/max-width binding renders nothing rather than a token.
- Composite components (Breadcrumb, Alert, RadioGroup) reuse the system's existing components (Link, Button, Text) from the same package rather than re-implementing them, and never restyle a child (no class overrides, no `::part`, no style props reaching into it): if a child needs a variation, the child's schema grows.
- Transitions use the component's own `transition` binding (its token and description), with `motion.easing.standard`; `motion.duration.fast` is only the default when a component has no `transition` binding.
- Development-only warnings the docs ask for use the platform convention: `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'` (React), `import.meta.env.DEV` (Lit), `__DEV__` (React Native).
- Stories are named after the prop and value in PascalCase (`ToneInfo`, `RoleBanner`); demo stories are titled `Demo/<Name>/<Platform>`.
- Icons: use the system `Icon` component for every glyph the docs name (`<Icon name="external" inline />`, `<ds-icon name="close">`, `<Icon name="check" color={…} />`); never draw an inline SVG or a Unicode glyph by hand. Decorative icons take no label; a glyph that carries meaning gets one.
- Stories: Storybook 10 CSF3 with `@storybook/web-components-vite` and `html` from lit; title `'<Name>/Lit'`; one story per enum value plus Default.
- TypeScript 7 with `isolatedDeclarations`: every exported symbol carries an explicit type annotation and no export type is inferred — `protected override render(): TemplateResult` (`TemplateResult | typeof nothing` when a branch renders nothing), typed static members, public methods with return types, `const meta: Meta = …` in stories. `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` (`name?: T | undefined`), `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and `verbatimModuleSyntax` (`import type`) are on.
- Tests run on Vitest 5 browser mode over Vite 8 (Playwright, Chromium; helpers from `vitest/browser`); the behavior scenarios below become `Divider.test.ts`.

## Declared contracts

The sections between the schema and the overrides resolve what the schema declares for lit; a section is absent when the component declares none of it. Where one disagrees with prose or a rule above, the section wins.

- **Events**: dispatch each as a `CustomEvent` under its emitted name whose `detail` has exactly the listed keys, and type `reason` as the union of its reasons. A `cancelable` event is dispatched with `cancelable: true`, and the element skips the default action when `dispatchEvent` returns `false`. Fire only for the listed `fires` sources, in the `timing` order given.
- **Controlled state**: implement every pair: controlled when the property is set, uncontrolled from the default property otherwise (`@state`), the event fired in both modes; a controlled element shows the new state only once the property changes.
- **Parts and slots**: render each slot only as `<slot>` under its resolved name (the default slot unnamed). A composed part receives exactly the listed `props`, and each forward reaches the child's `overrides` under the child binding named; add no other.
- **Style bindings**: a binding styles its `part` (the `data-part` element in the shadow root), only in its `state` (`:hover`, `:focus-visible`, the reflected state attribute), with the token listed for each `by` value; write `computed` as the given `calc()`. Never introduce a literal: the literal gate still applies.
- **Keyboard**: implement the listed rules as written and none the section excludes; `target` is the part that opens or closes, `repeat` the presses, and a `native` rule needs no code. A rule with `given` needs the `Keyboard` story to accept those args from the story URL shown.
- **Form and overlay**: a field registers through the one form contract `discovery` names, submitting `value` as `valueType` under `name` and running `validation` in order with the `messages` copy. An overlay anchors to `anchor`, reads `placement`, handles overflow by `collision`, dismisses exactly by `dismiss` through `closeEvent`, and is modal only when `modal` is true; this replaces the overlay defaults above.
- **Copy**: interpolate only the listed `params` and props; select a plural form with `new Intl.PluralRules(locale).select(count)`; never concatenate a count into a sentence.
- **Constants and examples**: logic reads each constant through its token expression, never the number it resolves to today. Every example is a story with the name shown and exactly its `given` as args.
- **Lifecycle**: a deprecated property, event, value or element keeps working, carries a `@deprecated` JSDoc tag naming `use`, and warns once in development (`import.meta.env.DEV`) naming `use`.
- A `type: integer` prop accepts whole numbers only: type it `number` and never produce a fraction.

        and is an accessibility element with that label (VoiceOver reads it as a section
        break); the label Text takes `fontSize` through `overrides`. Not SwiftUI's
        `Divider` (fixed color).
```

## Overrides (per-instance styling contract)

Every style binding above becomes a CSS custom-property hook on `:host`, named `--ds-<tag-without-prefix>-<binding>` (kebab-case), defaulting to its token: `:host {{ --ds-button-padding-inline: var(--space-md) }}` and rules read `var(--ds-button-padding-inline)`, never the token directly. Interpolated bindings set the hook per reflected attribute (`:host([variant="primary"]) {{ --ds-button-background: var(--color-action-primary-background) }}`). Because document styles on the host beat `:host` rules, consumers can override from CSS (`ds-button.hero {{ --ds-button-padding-inline: var(--space-lg) }}`) — that is the sanctioned escape hatch.

The element also has an `overrides` property (`attribute: false`, `Partial<Record<OverridableBinding, TokenRef>>`, `TokenRef` from `@design-schema/tokens`) that sets the hooks with `this.style.setProperty(hook, 'var(--<token-kebab>)')`. Locked bindings are not in the type and are ignored. No `::part` is exposed for styling.

Overrides change values, never presence: a prop that turns a part off (`surface: none`, `border: false`, `radius: none`) makes the matching overrides no-ops; apply an override only where the binding is in effect.

Overridable: `color`, `thickness`, `spacing`, `labelSize`, `labelGap`, `fontFamily`
Locked (accessibility-bearing, never overridable): `labelColor`

## Behavior scenarios (7)

Each scenario below becomes one test. They are platform-neutral: `given` are prop overrides on the `Default` story's args, `when` is one interaction, `then` is a list of expectations. Scenarios marked `derived` were produced by the parser from the schema; the rest were written in the doc. Render every scenario; never skip one because the component does not satisfy it. A scenario the code fails is a failing test, and a scenario that cannot be expressed on this platform is a gap to report, not a test to delete.

```yaml
- name: renders
  then:
  - renders: true
  derived: true
- name: renders-orientation-horizontal
  given:
    orientation: horizontal
  then:
  - renders: true
  derived: true
- name: renders-orientation-vertical
  given:
    orientation: vertical
  then:
  - renders: true

## Guidance

## Overview

A divider is a line, and the question it always raises is whether the line means something. Between two rows of a list it is furniture: it helps the eye and says nothing. Between "Today" and "Earlier" it is structure a screen-reader user should hear. Divider makes that choice explicit instead of leaving it to whether someone remembered `aria-hidden`.

## When to use

Use a Divider between items in a dense list where whitespace alone does not separate them, between groups in a menu (Menu renders its own), between toolbar groups (`vertical`), and with a `label` as an "or" between alternatives (sign in with email — or — with a provider) or a date heading in a feed. Use `spacing` when the divider stands outside a Stack.

## When not to use

Do not use dividers between page sections; use `section` spacing and headings — a page full of rules is a page without rhythm. Do not use a divider under a heading as decoration. Do not use a labelled divider as a heading substitute; if the label introduces content, it is a Heading. Do not rely on a divider alone to separate interactive regions.

## Behavior

Renders a one-token-thick line in the border color along the chosen axis, with optional symmetric spacing. With `label`, the text is centered with a line on each side and the divider becomes semantic. Nothing is interactive.

## Content guidelines

Labels are one to three words, sentence case or lowercase for conjunctions ("or"), no punctuation. Date and group labels match the headings elsewhere on the screen.

## Accessibility

Decorative dividers are hidden from assistive technology so lists do not announce "separator" between every row (WCAG 1.3.1 — structure is conveyed by the list, not the line). Semantic dividers expose role `separator` with `aria-orientation`, and labelled ones read their text. The line is below the 3:1 non-text threshold on purpose — it is not required to identify anything (1.4.11 exemption), and the label, when present, meets 4.5:1.

## Platform notes

### Web
Decorative: `<hr aria-hidden="true" class="ds-divider">`. Semantic: `<div role="separator" aria-orientation={orientation}>` with, for a label, two flex-grow line spans around a `Text size="sm" tone="muted"`. Vertical uses `inline-size: var(--border-width-thin); align-self: stretch`.

### Lit
`<ds-divider>`; `<ds-divider semantic label="or">`. Host carries the styles and, when semantic, `internals.role = 'separator'` and `ariaOrientation`. The label renders in the shadow root.

### React Native
`View` with `height: t.borderWidthThin, backgroundColor: t.colorBorder` (or width for vertical, `alignSelf: 'stretch'`). Decorative: hidden from AT. Labelled: a row of two lines with a `Text` between; the text is what gets read.
