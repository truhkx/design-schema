# Generate: Button for SwiftUI (iOS)

You are generating a production component for the **Design Schema** design system. The component schema below is the source of truth. Do not invent props, events, or styles that are not in it, and do not omit any that are.

## Output

Write `packages/swiftui/Sources/DesignSchema/Button.swift` declaring `public struct Button: View` with a public initializer whose parameters are the schema's props **in the schema's order** (doc defaults as default arguments), then the event closures in the schema's order, then `overrides:`; nested `public enum`s for enum props (`String` raw values equal to the doc values, case names the values camel-cased — `icon-only` → `iconOnly` — with leading digits moved to the end, `2xl` → `xl2`, since nothing else is a Swift identifier); `public struct`s for `array`/`object` shapes named from the shape; closures for events named per `platforms.swiftui`; and `#Preview` blocks. That order and those names are a contract: `tools/behavior_tests.ts` writes `Tests/DesignSchemaTests/Generated/ButtonBehaviorTests.swift` from the doc's `behavior` block and calls this initializer directly. Beside it write `packages/swiftui/Sources/DesignSchema/Gallery+Button.swift`: `public extension Gallery { static var <name>Screen: GalleryEntry { GalleryEntry("Button") { … } } }`, one gallery screen showing the component in its states, where `<name>Screen` is the component name with a lower-case first letter. Never edit `Support/Gallery+Generated.swift` — the generator rewrites that list from the screen files.

## Rules

- Render the SwiftUI view declared under `platforms.swiftui.element` with the modifiers listed under `platforms.swiftui.props`. Map each event to its `platforms.swiftui` name.
- Read tokens from `@Environment(\.dsTheme)` (`DesignSchemaTokens`). Colors are `Color`, dimensions `CGFloat` points, durations `TimeInterval`, easings `Animation`, font weights `Font.Weight`, line heights unitless multipliers. Never hard-code a color, size, font or duration. A style binding like `color.action.{variant}.background` becomes a lookup keyed by the enum value.
- Implement every item in `a11y.requires` with SwiftUI's accessibility API:
  - `accessible-name`: `.accessibilityLabel(label)`; a visually hidden label is still the label.
  - `keyboard-operable` / `focus-visible`: `.focusable()` where the doc's keyboard table applies, `@FocusState` for the roving index, `.dsOnKeyPress` (the package's own wrapper around `.onKeyPress(keys:)`, so the behavior gate can reach the same handler) / `.onMoveCommand` / `.onExitCommand` for the keys, and the focus ring drawn from `focusRing`/`focusRingWidth` only for keyboard focus.
  - `target-24px` / `target-44px`: `.frame(minWidth: theme.sizeTargetMin, minHeight: …)` (or `sizeTargetComfortable`) plus `.contentShape(Rectangle())`.
  - `heading-hierarchy`: `.accessibilityAddTraits(.isHeader)`; `.accessibilityHeading(.h1…h6)` from the level prop.
  - `live-region`: `AccessibilityNotification.Announcement`.
  - `reduced-motion`: `@Environment(\.accessibilityReduceMotion)` disables every animation the doc names.
  - `selected-state` / `expanded-state`: `.isSelected` trait or `.accessibilityValue("expanded"/"collapsed")`.
  - `gesture-alternative`: every gesture has a visible control and an `.accessibilityAction`.
- `disabled` uses `opacity.disabled` on the whole element, `.accessibilityRespondsToUserInteraction(false)` and a press guard; never `.disabled(true)` unless the doc says the control leaves the focus order.
- `content` props are `@ViewBuilder` generic closures. Enum props whose values are quoted digits (Heading `level`, Stack `gap`) accept `Int` as well.
- Use every `copy.*` string verbatim through `String(localized:)`-ready constants; do not write your own user-facing text.
- Testability hooks: `.accessibilityIdentifier("Button")` on the root and `"Button.<part>"` on every anatomy part, names verbatim. The generated behavior tests find everything through them and assert against the accessibility tree, so a state the doc names has to be visible there: `expanded` as `.accessibilityValue("expanded")`/`("collapsed")`, `selected` as `.isSelected`, `disabled` as an element that reports itself not enabled.
- `keyboard` rules describe the web keyboard model; implement the subset an iPad hardware keyboard can reach and expose everything else through accessibility actions and visible controls. Overlays follow the conventions (sheet / fullScreenCover / popover / confirmationDialog / Menu).
- Props of type `array`, `object`, or `function` carry a `shape` string in TypeScript notation; translate it to a Swift `struct`/closure type with the same member names. `ReactNode` is a `@ViewBuilder` closure or `AnyView`.
- Interpolated style bindings (`color.status.{tone}.background`) resolve per enum value at render time; a resolved path ending in `.default` drops that segment; an enum value of `none` for a background/border/max-width binding renders nothing rather than a token.
- Composite components reuse the system's existing views (`Button`, `Link`, `Text`, `Heading`, `Icon`, `Stack`) from the package rather than re-implementing them, and never restyle a child: if a child needs a variation, the child's schema grows.
- Transitions use the component's own `transition` binding with `motion.easing.standard`; `motion.duration.fast` is only the default when a component has no `transition` binding.
- Development-only warnings use `#if DEBUG`.
- Previews are named after the prop and value in PascalCase (`ToneInfo`, `RoleBanner`).
- Icons: use `Icon(name:)` for every glyph the docs name; never draw a glyph inline and never use SF Symbols.
- Swift 6 strict concurrency: value-type views, `@MainActor` only around UIKit calls, no `@unchecked Sendable`.

## Declared contracts

The sections between the schema and the overrides resolve what the schema declares for swiftui; a section is absent when the component declares none of it. Where one disagrees with prose or a rule above, the section wins.

- **Events**: each closure takes exactly the listed arguments, in order, and `reason` is a nested `enum` of its reasons. A `cancelable` closure returns `Bool`, and `false` skips the default action. Fire only for the listed `fires` sources, in the `timing` order given.
- **Controlled state**: every pair becomes a `Binding<T>?` parameter plus the default's initial value, with `@State` holding the uncontrolled value; the closure fires in both modes, and a bound view shows the new state only once the binding changes.
- **Parts and slots**: each slot is a `@ViewBuilder` parameter under its resolved label only (`content` for the default slot). A composed part receives exactly the listed `props`, and each forward reaches the child's `overrides:` under the child binding named; add no other.
- **Style bindings**: a binding styles the view for its `part`, only in its `state` (`.onHover`, `@FocusState`, or the view's own state), with the token listed for each `by` value; write `computed` as the given multiplication of `theme` values. Never introduce a literal: the literal gate still applies.
- **Keyboard**: implement the listed rules as written and none the section excludes; `target` is the part that opens or closes, `repeat` the presses, and a `native` rule needs no code. A rule with `given` applies when those props are set.
- **Form and overlay**: a field registers through the one form contract `discovery` names, submitting `value` as `valueType` under `name` and running `validation` in order with the `messages` copy. An overlay anchors to `anchor`, reads `placement`, dismisses exactly by `dismiss` through `closeEvent`, and is modal only when `modal` is true; this picks among the conventions' overlay forms.
- **Copy**: interpolate only the listed `params` and props; select plural forms through `String(localized:)` with the entry's forms as its plural variations; never concatenate a count into a sentence.
- **Constants and examples**: logic reads each constant through its token expression, never the number it resolves to today. Every example becomes a `#Preview` with the name shown and exactly its `given`.
- **Lifecycle**: a deprecated parameter, closure, case or view keeps working, is marked `@available(*, deprecated, message:)` naming `use`, and warns once under `#if DEBUG` naming `use`.
- A `type: integer` prop is an `Int`: whole numbers only.

        unchanged, and blocks repeat activation while an action is pending.

## Events

- `onPress`: emit `action`
  - fires on: user

## Parts and slots

- `container`: element
- `label`: element
- `leadingIcon`: slot, `@ViewBuilder` parameter `leadingIcon`
- `trailingIcon`: slot, `@ViewBuilder` parameter `trailingIcon`

## Style bindings

- `backgroundHover`: token `color.action.{variant}.backgroundHover`; state `hover`

## Constants and examples

- example `primary-save`, story `PrimarySave`: given `label: "Save changes"`, `variant: "primary"`; The single most important action in a view, labelled with the outcome.
- example `destructive-confirm`, story `DestructiveConfirm`: given `label: "Delete file"`, `variant: "danger"`; A destructive, hard-to-undo action, which is the only use of the danger variant.
- example `icon-only-in-a-toolbar`, story `IconOnlyInAToolbar`: given `label: "Close"`, `iconOnly: true`, `variant: "ghost"`, `size: "sm"`; A low-emphasis icon-only control in dense UI, whose label says what it does rather than what the icon depicts.

## Overrides (per-instance styling contract)

The component accepts `overrides: [Binding: TokenRef] = [:]` where `Binding` is a nested `public enum Binding: String, CaseIterable` listing the overridable bindings below and `TokenRef` is the token-name enum generated into `DesignSchemaTokens`. Resolve each entry with `theme[ref]` and use the typed result in place of the binding's default token. This is the ONLY per-instance styling surface: there is no style modifier parameter, so a screen cannot drift from the system by passing points. Locked bindings are not cases of `Binding`.

Overrides change values, never presence: a prop that turns a part off (`surface: none`, `border: false`, `radius: none`) makes the matching overrides no-ops; apply an override only where the binding is in effect.

Overridable: `backgroundHover`, `iconGap`, `paddingInline`, `paddingBlock`, `radius`, `fontFamily`, `fontWeight`, `fontSize`, `disabledOpacity`, `transition`, `loadingSpin`
Locked (accessibility-bearing, never overridable): `background`, `foreground`, `focusRing`, `focusRingWidth`, `inverseForeground`, `inverseFocusRing`, `minTarget`, `spinnerStroke`

## Platform notes (swiftui)

```yaml
element: Button
props:
- action
- .buttonStyle=custom
- .accessibilityLabel
- .accessibilityHint
- .accessibilityAddTraits=isButton
- .frame=minWidth-minHeight
- .contentShape
- .focusable
- .focused
- .onLongPressGesture
notes: A SwiftUI `Button(action:)` with a package `ButtonStyle` (`DSButtonStyle`)
  that draws variant/size from tokens and reads `isPressed` for the pressed state;
  hover from `.onHover` on iPad pointer. `iconOnly` sets `.accessibilityLabel(label)`
  and hides the text; `accessibleName` overrides the label (and must start with the
  visible one); `loading` sets `.accessibilityValue(copy.loading)`, disables presses
  without `.disabled`, and swaps the leading icon for a `ProgressView` tinted from
  the foreground token. `disabled` is `.accessibilityRespondsToUserInteraction(false)`
  + `.opacity` + guard, keeping the button focusable per the doc. Long press forwards
  to Tooltip through `onLongPress`; `accessibilityHint` is forwarded verbatim. `overflowLabel`
  is read by Toolbar only.
```

## Guidance

## Overview

Buttons let people take actions and make choices with a single tap or click. They communicate what will happen through their label, and their emphasis through their variant.

## When to use

Use a Button when the user needs to **do something**: submit, save, confirm, open, add, delete. The label should be a verb or verb phrase that describes the outcome ("Save changes", not "OK").

Use the `primary` variant for the single most important action in a view. Use `secondary` for the alternatives beside it, `ghost` for low-emphasis actions in dense UI such as toolbars, and `danger` only for destructive, hard-to-undo actions.

## When not to use

Do not use a Button to **navigate** to another page or screen; use a Link (or a Link styled as a button) so the destination is exposed to assistive technology and works with open-in-new-tab. Do not use more than one `primary` button in the same region — if everything is emphasized, nothing is. Do not use `disabled` to communicate *why* an action is unavailable; prefer keeping the button enabled and explaining the problem on activation, or show the reason inline.

## Behavior

Activation fires `onPress` exactly once per pointer click, Enter key, Space key, or assistive-technology activation. While `loading` is true the button announces itself as busy and ignores further activation, but keeps its size so the layout does not shift. `disabled` buttons remain focusable so that keyboard and screen-reader users can discover them; they are announced as "dimmed" or "disabled" and do not fire `onPress`.

Labels are sentence case, one to three words, and start with a verb. Avoid "Yes"/"No"; restate the action ("Delete file" / "Keep file"). Icon-only buttons must set `label` to what the button does, not what the icon depicts ("Close", not "X").

## Accessibility

Every button must have an accessible name (WCAG 4.1.2). The name comes from the visible label or, for `iconOnly`, from the `label` prop rendered as `aria-label` / `accessibilityLabel`. Focus must be visible (WCAG 2.4.7 and 2.4.11): the focus ring uses `color.border.focus` at `border.width.focus` and is never removed without a replacement. The interactive target is at least 24×24 CSS px (WCAG 2.5.8, AA) at every `size`, and 44×44 on touch platforms following iOS and Android guidelines. Text and background pairs for every variant meet 4.5:1 (WCAG 1.4.3) in both light and dark themes — the build checks this against the tokens. Buttons are activated with Enter and Space, and never rely on hover alone to convey state.

## Platform notes

### Web
Render a native `<button>` with `type` from the prop (default `button`, so a button inside a form never submits by accident). Use `aria-disabled="true"` for the disabled state; the button stays in the tab order. Set `aria-busy="true"` while loading.

### Lit
The host element `<ds-button>` reflects `variant`, `size`, `disabled`, `icon-only` and `loading` as attributes so consumers can style states from outside the shadow root. The inner element is a real `<button>`; the shadow root is created with `delegatesFocus: true`. Activation dispatches a composed, bubbling `press` CustomEvent. Consumers can also listen to the native `click` that bubbles out of the shadow root.

### React Native
Render a `Pressable` with `accessibilityRole="button"`, `accessibilityLabel={label}` and `accessibilityState={{ disabled, busy: loading }}`. There is no CSS cascade, so every style binding is applied explicitly from the token object. Because there is no hover on touch, `backgroundHover` is used for the pressed state. Icons passed as `leadingIcon`/`trailingIcon` are rendered as given: there is no cascade, so Button cannot recolor them, and callers color glyphs with the variant's foreground themselves until an Icon component exists. When the visual footprint is smaller than 44px, add `hitSlop` to reach the comfortable target size.

## Extensions

The schema above already includes what these extensions add (items marked `source: extensions/...`). Implement them like any other prop, event, binding, copy string, keyboard rule or scenario.

### analytics — `extensions/Button.analytics.md`

Product analytics needs to know which buttons people press, without every screen wiring its own handler and without the generated Button knowing which analytics vendor is in use. `track` names the event; when it is set, a press calls the hand-written `trackPress` module with the event name and the button's visible label, then fires `onTrack` with the same pair so a screen can react (a toast, a redirect) without touching analytics itself.

The module is the seam. `packages/<platform>/src/custom/analytics.ts` is owned by the adopter: in development it logs the pair to the console; in production it is a no-op until someone points it at a vendor SDK. The generated component imports `trackPress` from `./custom/analytics` and calls it exactly once per press, after `onPress` and before `onTrack`, only when `track` is set. It never reads or rewrites the module body, and a press with no `track` is exactly the upstream Button.

**Hand-written modules** — import and call them exactly as stated; never create, edit or copy anything under `src/custom/`:

- `import { trackPress } from './custom/analytics';` — signature `(name: string, label: string) => void`. Called from onPress when `track` is set, before onTrack fires.
