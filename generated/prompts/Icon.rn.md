# Generate: Icon for React Native

You are generating a production component for the **Design Schema** design system. The component schema below is the source of truth. Do not invent props, events, or styles that are not in it, and do not omit any that are.

## Output

Write `packages/rn/src/Icon.tsx` exporting a typed React Native function component named `Icon`.

## Rules

- React Native 0.87 with its strict TypeScript API (the default): import instance types for refs (`ViewInstance`, `TextInputInstance`, `ScrollViewInstance`, `HostInstance`), whole event types (`TextInputFocusEvent`, `LayoutChangeEvent`), and treat `ViewStyle`/`TextStyle` as read-only.
- React 19: `ref` is a prop; no forwardRef; `useId`. A component that exposes its root declares `ref?: Ref<ViewInstance> | undefined` (the root's instance type) in `IconProps` and attaches it to the root; never `React.forwardRef`, `useActionState` or `useFormStatus`.
- Render the component declared under `platforms.rn.element` with the props listed under `platforms.rn.props`. Map each event to its `platforms.rn` name.
- Import tokens from `@design-schema/tokens/<theme-id>/rn/light` and `/dark` (flat ESM modules with `.d.ts`; the theme id is in the theme skill) and read the active mode from the package's `useTheme()` hook (`ThemeProvider` with mode light | dark | system). Dimensions and durations are numbers; `fontWeight` tokens are numbers and must be converted to RN's string union; `font.lineHeight.*` are unitless multipliers — multiply by the font size; `fontFamilyBody` is `"System"`. Never hard-code a color, size, or font. A style binding like `color.action.{variant}.background` becomes `tokens[\`colorAction${capitalize(variant)}Background\`]`.
- Implement every item in `a11y.requires` with React Native's accessibility API:
  - `accessible-name`: `accessibilityLabel={label}`.
  - `keyboard-operable` / `focus-visible`: rely on the native focus system; for `Pressable`, style the focused/pressed state via the `style` callback.
  - `target-24px` / `target-44px`: `minWidth`/`minHeight` from `tokens.sizeTargetMin` / `tokens.sizeTargetComfortable`, and `hitSlop` where the visual is smaller.
  - `heading-hierarchy`: RN has no heading levels — set `accessibilityRole="header"` and document that the `level` prop only controls typography.
- `disabled` sets `accessibilityState={{ disabled: true }}` in addition to `disabled`.
- There is no CSS cascade: every style must be explicit on the element.
- Enum props whose values are quoted digits (Heading `level`, Stack `gap`) accept both the string and the number.
- `disabled` uses `opacity.disabled` on the whole element; never invent a disabled color.
- Use every `copy.*` string verbatim; do not write your own user-facing text.
- Testability hooks: the root carries `testID="<Name>"` (react-native-web renders it as data-testid); a component with a `keyboard` block ships a story exported as `Keyboard` rendering it open with its trigger and at least three focusable children, for the axe gate and manual keyboard checks on react-native-web.
- `keyboard` rules describe the web keyboard model; on native implement the subset hardware keyboards can reach (Escape/back gesture = dismiss, Enter = activate) and expose everything else through accessibility actions and visible controls. Overlays: modal dialogs, sheets and action sheets use the native `Modal` (`accessibilityViewIsModal`, `onRequestClose` for the Android back button, `statusBarTranslucent`); the scrim is a `Pressable` with `color.overlay.scrim`; sheets animate from the bottom with `Animated` and support drag-to-dismiss ONLY as an addition to a visible close control (`gesture-alternative`); tooltips are not a native pattern — render the tooltip text as `accessibilityHint` and show it on long-press only; toasts use a portal-less `View` with `layer.toast` zIndex at the root.
- Props of type `array`, `object`, or `function` carry a `shape` string in TypeScript notation; use it verbatim as the type. Prop type `content` is `ReactNode` / a slot / `ReactNode` by platform.
- Interpolated style bindings (`color.status.{tone}.background`) resolve per enum value at render time; never enumerate them by hand where a lookup will do. A resolved path ending in `.default` drops that segment (`color.background.{surface}` with `default` is `color.background`, i.e. `--color-background` / `colorBackground`); an enum value of `none` for a background/border/max-width binding renders nothing rather than a token.
- Composite components (Breadcrumb, Alert, RadioGroup) reuse the system's existing components (Link, Button, Text) from the same package rather than re-implementing them, and never restyle a child (no class overrides, no `::part`, no style props reaching into it): if a child needs a variation, the child's schema grows.
- Transitions use the component's own `transition` binding (its token and description), with `motion.easing.standard`; `motion.duration.fast` is only the default when a component has no `transition` binding.
- Development-only warnings the docs ask for use the platform convention: `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'` (React), `import.meta.env.DEV` (Lit), `__DEV__` (React Native).
- Stories are named after the prop and value in PascalCase (`ToneInfo`, `RoleBanner`); demo stories are titled `Demo/<Name>/<Platform>`.
- Icons: use the system `Icon` component for every glyph the docs name (`<Icon name="external" inline />`, `<ds-icon name="close">`, `<Icon name="check" color={…} />`); never draw an inline SVG or a Unicode glyph by hand. Decorative icons take no label; a glyph that carries meaning gets one.
- Stories: Storybook 10 CSF3 with `@storybook/react-vite`, run under react-native-web; title `'<Name>/React Native'`; one story per enum value plus Default; wrap in `ThemeProvider`.
- TypeScript 7 with `isolatedDeclarations`: every exported symbol carries an explicit type annotation and no export type is inferred — the component returns `React.JSX.Element` (`| null` when it can render nothing), exported constants, contexts and hooks are annotated, `const meta: Meta<typeof Icon> = …` in stories. `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` (`name?: T | undefined`), `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and `verbatimModuleSyntax` (`import type`) are on.
- Tests run on Jest 30 with `@react-native/jest-preset` and `@testing-library/react-native` 13 (synchronous `render`/`fireEvent`); the behavior scenarios below become `Icon.test.tsx`.

```

## Overrides (per-instance styling contract)

The component accepts `overrides?: Partial<Record<OverridableBinding, TokenRef>>` where `OverridableBinding` is the union of the overridable bindings below and `TokenRef` is the token-name union exported by `@design-schema/tokens` (dotted names, e.g. `'space.lg'`). Resolve each entry through the theme with `resolveToken(t, ref)` — both `TokenRef` and `resolveToken` are imported from `@design-schema/tokens`, not from `./theme` (dotted → camelCase key), and use the result in place of the binding's default token. This is the ONLY per-instance styling surface: there is no `style` prop, so a screen cannot drift from the system by passing pixels. Locked bindings are not in the type and are ignored if passed.

Overrides change values, never presence: a prop that turns a part off (`surface: none`, `border: false`, `radius: none`) makes the matching overrides no-ops; apply an override only where the binding is in effect.

The `platforms.rn.props` list names the native props the schema cares about; `overrides` and `testID` apply to every component regardless of whether that list mentions them.

Overridable: `size`, `color`
Locked (accessibility-bearing, never overridable): `strokeWidth`

## Behavior scenarios (33)

Each scenario below becomes one test. They are platform-neutral: `given` are prop overrides on the `Default` story's args, `when` is one interaction, `then` is a list of expectations. Scenarios marked `derived` were produced by the parser from the schema; the rest were written in the doc. Render every scenario; never skip one because the component does not satisfy it. A scenario the code fails is a failing test, and a scenario that cannot be expressed on this platform is a gap to report, not a test to delete.

## Guidance

## Overview

Icons are the one place Tier 1 had nothing to build from: every component drew its own check mark, chevron and status shape. Icon centralizes them. It is a primitive, not a design element in its own right: it has no tone of its own, takes its color from the text it sits in, and its size from the type scale, so a glyph beside a label always matches the label.

## When to use

Use an Icon wherever a component's anatomy names one: the leading icon in a Button, the chevron in a Disclosure, the status shape in an Alert, the check in a Checkbox, the external mark on a Link, the ellipsis in a collapsed Breadcrumb. Use `inline` when the icon is inside running text. Give it a `label` only when the icon is the whole message — a lone warning triangle in a table cell, say — and the label is what a screen reader should say instead.

## When not to use

Do not use an Icon as a button; wrap it in a Button with `iconOnly` and a `label`, which brings the target size, focus ring and accessible name. Do not use Icons as illustration or decoration at large sizes; that is an Illustration component (not planned) or an image. Do not add a glyph to the set for one screen; the set grows when a *component* needs a shape, and until then product code passes its own SVG to the slot that accepts content.

## Behavior

An Icon renders a single glyph at the requested size and does nothing else: no interaction, no focus, no animation. Its color is the surrounding text color on web and Lit (`currentColor`); on React Native the parent supplies it. Decorative icons (no `label`) are invisible to assistive technology so that "Save" is announced as "Save", not "check mark Save". Labelled icons are announced as images with their label.

## Content guidelines

Glyph geometry on the 16×16 grid, for glyphs with no existing path to reuse: `play` is a filled triangle (4,2)→(14,8)→(4,14); `pause` is two filled 3×12 bars at x=3 and x=10 from y=2; `folder` is an outlined shape from (2,4) to (14,13) whose top edge steps up to y=2 between x=2 and x=7 (the tab), a line glyph; `file` is an outlined rectangle from (4,2) to (12,14) with the top-right corner cut by a diagonal from (9,2) to (12,5) and that corner folded (a line from (9,2) down to (9,5) across to (12,5)), a line glyph; `list` is three horizontal lines from x=5 to x=14 at y=4, 8, 12 with a dot at x=2 on each; `grid` is four 5×5 outlined squares at (2,2), (9,2), (2,9), (9,9); `menu` is three horizontal lines from x=2 to x=14 at y=4, 8 and 12 (a line glyph). `calendar` is an outlined rectangle from (2,3) to (14,14) with a header rule at y=6 and two hanger ticks at x=5 and x=11 from y=1 to y=4, drawn as a line glyph. Glyph names describe the shape or the universal meaning, not the use ("chevron-down", "close", "warning"), so the same icon can serve many components. `dash` is the short indeterminate mark (4–12 on the grid) used by Checkbox; `minus` is the full-width line (3–13) that pairs with `plus`. `danger` is an octagon with an ×; Alert's current exclamation octagon changes to it when Alert is regenerated to compose Icon. A `label`, when used, says what the icon means in context ("Warning: over quota"), not what it depicts ("triangle").

## Accessibility

Decorative icons are hidden from assistive technology (WCAG 1.1.1: they carry no information the adjacent text does not). Meaningful icons expose role `img` and an accessible name from `label` (1.1.1, 4.1.2). Icons never convey information by color alone: the four status glyphs are four different shapes (1.4.1). Because they are drawn in the text color, they inherit whatever contrast the text has; components that place an icon on a tinted surface (Alert, Meter) declare that pair themselves. Line glyphs use the focus-ring width as their stroke so they stay legible at `xs` (1.4.11 applies only when the icon is meaningful, and a labelled icon then sits in a component that declares the pair).

## Platform notes

### Web
Export a `paths` table keyed by `name`, drawn on a 16×16 grid: line glyphs are bare `<path>`s inheriting the root's `fill="none" stroke="currentColor"`; the four status shapes and the ellipsis are single `fill="currentColor" stroke="none" fill-rule="evenodd"` paths whose inner mark is a hole. Render `<svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="1em" height="1em" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round">` with `stroke-width: var(--border-width-focus)` and `vector-effect: non-scaling-stroke` on paths in CSS. Size: `font-size: var(--font-size-{size})` on the element (attributes cannot take custom properties); `display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle`; with `inline`, `font-size: inherit; vertical-align: -0.125em`. Reuse the existing Disclosure/Link/Breadcrumb/Alert path data for chevrons, external, ellipsis and close so the later swap is visually neutral. Decorative: `aria-hidden="true"`; labelled: `role="img"` and `aria-label`. Always `focusable="false"`. Button, Link, Alert, Disclosure, Checkbox, RadioGroup and Breadcrumb should be updated to render `<Icon>` instead of their private glyphs in the next regeneration.

### Lit
`<ds-icon name="check" size="sm">` renders the same SVG in its shadow root; `:host { display: inline-flex; color: inherit }` and `:host([inline]) { display: inline-block; vertical-align: -0.125em; inline-size: 1em; block-size: 1em }`. Reflect `name`, `size` and `inline`. The paths table is a module-private constant; other elements compose `<ds-icon>`.

### React Native
Import `Svg` and `Path` from `react-native-svg` and render the shared `paths` table (export it from a `paths.ts` in the RN package, byte-identical to the web table so the swap stays visually neutral): `<Svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width={size} height={size} fill="none" stroke={color} strokeWidth={strokeWidth} strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round">` with `<Path d>` per glyph; filled glyphs pass `fill={color} stroke="none" fillRule="evenodd"`. `size` and `strokeWidth` come from the tokens through `useTheme()`. With `inline` nested in the system Text, size from the parent's font size via `TextNestingContext`; otherwise `font.size.md`. `color` from the prop, defaulting to `color.foreground`. Decorative: `accessibilityElementsHidden`, `importantForAccessibility="no"`; labelled: `accessibilityRole="image"`, `accessibilityLabel`. No Unicode fallback remains.
