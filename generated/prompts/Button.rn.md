# Generate: Button for React Native

You are generating a production component for the **Design Schema** design system. The component schema below is the source of truth. Do not invent props, events, or styles that are not in it, and do not omit any that are.

## Output

Write `packages/rn/src/Button.tsx` exporting a typed React Native function component named `Button`.

## Rules

- React Native 0.87 with its strict TypeScript API (the default): import instance types for refs (`ViewInstance`, `TextInputInstance`, `ScrollViewInstance`, `HostInstance`), whole event types (`TextInputFocusEvent`, `LayoutChangeEvent`), and treat `ViewStyle`/`TextStyle` as read-only.
- React 19: `ref` is a prop; no forwardRef; `useId`. A component that exposes its root declares `ref?: Ref<ViewInstance> | undefined` (the root's instance type) in `ButtonProps` and attaches it to the root; never `React.forwardRef`, `useActionState` or `useFormStatus`.
- Render the component declared under `platforms.rn.element` with the props listed under `platforms.rn.props`. Map each event to its `platforms.rn` name.
- Import tokens from `@design-schema/tokens/<theme-id>/rn/light` and `/dark` (flat ESM modules with `.d.ts`; the theme id is in the theme skill) and read the active mode from the package's `useTheme()` hook (`ThemeProvider` with mode light | dark | system). Dimensions and durations are numbers; `fontWeight` tokens are numbers and must be converted to RN's string union; `font.lineHeight.*` are unitless multipliers — multiply by the font size; `fontFamilyBody` is `"System"`. Never hard-code a color, size, or font. A style binding like `color.action.{variant}.background` becomes `tokens[\`colorAction${capitalize(variant)}Background\`]`.
- Implement every item in `a11y.requires` with React Native's accessibility API:
  - `accessible-name`: `accessibilityLabel={label}`.
  - `keyboard-operable` / `focus-visible`: rely on the native focus system; for `Pressable`, style the focused/pressed state via the `style` callback.
  - `target-24px` / `target-44px`: `minWidth`/`minHeight` from `tokens.sizeTargetMin` / `tokens.sizeTargetComfortable`, and `hitSlop` where the visual is smaller.
  - `heading-hierarchy`: RN has no heading levels — set `accessibilityRole="header"` and document that the `level` prop only controls typography.
- `disabled` sets `accessibilityState={{ disabled: true }}` in addition to `disabled`.
- There is no CSS cascade: every style must be explicit on the element.
- Enum props whose values are quoted digits (Heading `level`, Stack `gap`) accept both the string and the number.
- `disabled` uses `opacity.disabled` on the whole element; never invent a disabled color.
- Use every `copy.*` string verbatim; do not write your own user-facing text.
- Testability hooks: the root carries `testID="<Name>"` (react-native-web renders it as data-testid); a component with a `keyboard` block ships a story exported as `Keyboard` rendering it open with its trigger and at least three focusable children, for the axe gate and manual keyboard checks on react-native-web.
- `keyboard` rules describe the web keyboard model; on native implement the subset hardware keyboards can reach (Escape/back gesture = dismiss, Enter = activate) and expose everything else through accessibility actions and visible controls. Overlays: modal dialogs, sheets and action sheets use the native `Modal` (`accessibilityViewIsModal`, `onRequestClose` for the Android back button, `statusBarTranslucent`); the scrim is a `Pressable` with `color.overlay.scrim`; sheets animate from the bottom with `Animated` and support drag-to-dismiss ONLY as an addition to a visible close control (`gesture-alternative`); tooltips are not a native pattern — render the tooltip text as `accessibilityHint` and show it on long-press only; toasts use a portal-less `View` with `layer.toast` zIndex at the root.
- Props of type `array`, `object`, or `function` carry a `shape` string in TypeScript notation; use it verbatim as the type. Prop type `content` is `ReactNode` / a slot / `ReactNode` by platform.
- Interpolated style bindings (`color.status.{tone}.background`) resolve per enum value at render time; never enumerate them by hand where a lookup will do. A resolved path ending in `.default` drops that segment (`color.background.{surface}` with `default` is `color.background`, i.e. `--color-background` / `colorBackground`); an enum value of `none` for a background/border/max-width binding renders nothing rather than a token.
- Composite components (Breadcrumb, Alert, RadioGroup) reuse the system's existing components (Link, Button, Text) from the same package rather than re-implementing them, and never restyle a child (no class overrides, no `::part`, no style props reaching into it): if a child needs a variation, the child's schema grows.
- Transitions use the component's own `transition` binding (its token and description), with `motion.easing.standard`; `motion.duration.fast` is only the default when a component has no `transition` binding.
- Development-only warnings the docs ask for use the platform convention: `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'` (React), `import.meta.env.DEV` (Lit), `__DEV__` (React Native).
- Stories are named after the prop and value in PascalCase (`ToneInfo`, `RoleBanner`); demo stories are titled `Demo/<Name>/<Platform>`.
- Icons: use the system `Icon` component for every glyph the docs name (`<Icon name="external" inline />`, `<ds-icon name="close">`, `<Icon name="check" color={…} />`); never draw an inline SVG or a Unicode glyph by hand. Decorative icons take no label; a glyph that carries meaning gets one.
- Stories: Storybook 10 CSF3 with `@storybook/react-vite`, run under react-native-web; title `'<Name>/React Native'`; one story per enum value plus Default; wrap in `ThemeProvider`.
- TypeScript 7 with `isolatedDeclarations`: every exported symbol carries an explicit type annotation and no export type is inferred — the component returns `React.JSX.Element` (`| null` when it can render nothing), exported constants, contexts and hooks are annotated, `const meta: Meta<typeof Button> = …` in stories. `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` (`name?: T | undefined`), `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and `verbatimModuleSyntax` (`import type`) are on.
- Tests run on Jest 30 with `@react-native/jest-preset` and `@testing-library/react-native` 13 (synchronous `render`/`fireEvent`); the behavior scenarios below become `Button.test.tsx`.

## Declared contracts

The sections between the schema and the overrides resolve what the schema declares for rn; a section is absent when the component declares none of it. Where one disagrees with prose or a rule above, the section wins.

- **Events**: call each handler prop under its emitted name with exactly the listed arguments, in order, and type `reason` as the union of its reasons. A `cancelable` event skips the default action when the handler returns `false`. Fire only for the listed `fires` sources, in the `timing` order given.
- **Controlled state**: implement every pair: controlled when the prop is provided, uncontrolled from the default otherwise (local state), the event fired in both modes; a controlled component shows the new state only once the prop changes.
- **Parts and slots**: render each slot only through its resolved `ReactNode` prop (`children` for the default slot). A composed part receives exactly the listed `props`, and each forward reaches the child's `overrides` under the child binding named; add no other.
- **Style bindings**: a binding styles the view for its `part`, only in its `state` (the `Pressable` style callback's `pressed`/`hovered`/`focused`, or the component's own state), with the token listed for each `by` value; write `computed` as the given multiplication of theme values (`t`). Never introduce a literal: the literal gate still applies.
- **Keyboard**: implement the listed rules as written and none the section excludes; `target` is the part that opens or closes, `repeat` the presses, and a `native` rule needs no code. A rule with `given` needs the `Keyboard` story to accept those props as Storybook args.
- **Form and overlay**: a field registers through the one form contract `discovery` names, submitting `value` as `valueType` under `name` and running `validation` in order with the `messages` copy. An overlay anchors to `anchor`, reads `placement`, handles overflow by `collision`, dismisses exactly by `dismiss` through `closeEvent`, and is modal only when `modal` is true; this replaces the overlay defaults above.
- **Copy**: interpolate only the listed `params` and props; select a plural form with `new Intl.PluralRules(locale).select(count)`; never concatenate a count into a sentence.
- **Constants and examples**: logic reads each constant through its token expression, never the number it resolves to today. Every example is a story with the name shown and exactly its `given` as args.
- **Lifecycle**: a deprecated prop, event, value or component keeps working, carries a `@deprecated` JSDoc tag naming `use`, and warns once under `__DEV__` naming `use`.
- A `type: integer` prop accepts whole numbers only: type it `number` and never produce a fraction.

      default: false
      description: Shows a 1em ring spinner in `currentColor` in the leading icon
        slot (whether or not `leadingIcon` is set; for `iconOnly` it replaces the
        sole glyph), hides `trailingIcon`, keeps the label visible and the layout
        unchanged, and blocks repeat activation while an action is pending.

        at 12% over the surface (the sanctioned color-mix of tokens on web/Lit; an
        alpha of the resolved color on native); the focus ring uses color.inverse.focus
        for every variant while `inverse` is true, since the ring must read against
        the inverse surface. Only `ghost` changes its fill on inverse surfaces; other

      notes: Wraps a native <button> in the shadow root with delegatesFocus so the
        host element is focusable. `press` is a composed CustomEvent. Icons are named
        slots `leading-icon` / `trailing-icon`. ds-button is NOT form-associated (a
        FACE with a reflected disabled attribute becomes truly disabled and unfocusable);
        `type=submit` is handled by ds-form listening for `press`, and by `closest('form')?.requestSubmit()`
        when placed directly in a native form.

        `type: submit` calls submit() on the nearest Form context, since there is
        no native form. Forwards `accessibilityHint`, `accessibilityLabel` (when set
        by a parent such as Tooltip), `onHoverIn`, `onHoverOut`, `onFocus`, `onBlur`
        and `onLongPress` to the native element, so Tooltip can attach to it.'

      notes: A SwiftUI `Button(action:)` with a package `ButtonStyle` (`DSButtonStyle`)
        that draws variant/size from tokens and reads `isPressed` for the pressed
        state; hover from `.onHover` on iPad pointer. `iconOnly` sets `.accessibilityLabel(label)`
        and hides the text; `accessibleName` overrides the label (and must start with
        the visible one); `loading` sets `.accessibilityValue(copy.loading)`, disables
        presses without `.disabled`, and swaps the leading icon for a `ProgressView`
        tinted from the foreground token. `disabled` is `.accessibilityRespondsToUserInteraction(false)`
        + `.opacity` + guard, keeping the button focusable per the doc. Long press
        forwards to Tooltip through `onLongPress`; `accessibilityHint` is forwarded
        verbatim. `overflowLabel` is read by Toolbar only.

## Events

- `onPress`: emit `onPress`
  - fires on: user

## Parts and slots

- `container`: element
- `label`: element
- `leadingIcon`: slot, prop `leadingIcon`
- `trailingIcon`: slot, prop `trailingIcon`

## Style bindings

- `backgroundHover`: token `color.action.{variant}.backgroundHover`; state `hover`

## Constants and examples

- example `primary-save`, story `PrimarySave`: given `label: "Save changes"`, `variant: "primary"`; The single most important action in a view, labelled with the outcome.
- example `destructive-confirm`, story `DestructiveConfirm`: given `label: "Delete file"`, `variant: "danger"`; A destructive, hard-to-undo action, which is the only use of the danger variant.
- example `icon-only-in-a-toolbar`, story `IconOnlyInAToolbar`: given `label: "Close"`, `iconOnly: true`, `variant: "ghost"`, `size: "sm"`; A low-emphasis icon-only control in dense UI, whose label says what it does rather than what the icon depicts.
- example `pending-submit`, story `PendingSubmit`: given `label: "Create account"`, `type: "submit"`, `loading: true`; The submit button of a form while the request is in flight - busy, and ignoring repeat activation.

## Overrides (per-instance styling contract)

The component accepts `overrides?: Partial<Record<OverridableBinding, TokenRef>>` where `OverridableBinding` is the union of the overridable bindings below and `TokenRef` is the token-name union exported by `@design-schema/tokens` (dotted names, e.g. `'space.lg'`). Resolve each entry through the theme with `resolveToken(t, ref)` — both `TokenRef` and `resolveToken` are imported from `@design-schema/tokens`, not from `./theme` (dotted → camelCase key), and use the result in place of the binding's default token. This is the ONLY per-instance styling surface: there is no `style` prop, so a screen cannot drift from the system by passing pixels. Locked bindings are not in the type and are ignored if passed.

Overrides change values, never presence: a prop that turns a part off (`surface: none`, `border: false`, `radius: none`) makes the matching overrides no-ops; apply an override only where the binding is in effect.

The `platforms.rn.props` list names the native props the schema cares about; `overrides` and `testID` apply to every component regardless of whether that list mentions them.

Overridable: `backgroundHover`, `iconGap`, `paddingInline`, `paddingBlock`, `radius`, `fontFamily`, `fontWeight`, `fontSize`, `disabledOpacity`, `transition`, `loadingSpin`
Locked (accessibility-bearing, never overridable): `background`, `foreground`, `focusRing`, `focusRingWidth`, `inverseForeground`, `inverseFocusRing`, `minTarget`, `spinnerStroke`

## Behavior scenarios (17)

Each scenario below becomes one test. They are platform-neutral: `given` are prop overrides on the `Default` story's args, `when` is one interaction, `then` is a list of expectations. Scenarios marked `derived` were produced by the parser from the schema; the rest were written in the doc. Render every scenario; never skip one because the component does not satisfy it. A scenario the code fails is a failing test, and a scenario that cannot be expressed on this platform is a gap to report, not a test to delete.

## Platform notes (rn)

```yaml
element: Pressable
props:
- accessibilityRole=button
- accessibilityLabel
- accessibilityState
- hitSlop
notes: 'No hover state on touch; backgroundHover is applied to the pressed state.
  `type: submit` calls submit() on the nearest Form context, since there is no native
  form. Forwards `accessibilityHint`, `accessibilityLabel` (when set by a parent such
  as Tooltip), `onHoverIn`, `onHoverOut`, `onFocus`, `onBlur` and `onLongPress` to
  the native element, so Tooltip can attach to it.'

## Guidance

## Overview

Buttons let people take actions and make choices with a single tap or click. They communicate what will happen through their label, and their emphasis through their variant.

## When to use

Use a Button when the user needs to **do something**: submit, save, confirm, open, add, delete. The label should be a verb or verb phrase that describes the outcome ("Save changes", not "OK").

Use the `primary` variant for the single most important action in a view. Use `secondary` for the alternatives beside it, `ghost` for low-emphasis actions in dense UI such as toolbars, and `danger` only for destructive, hard-to-undo actions.

## When not to use

Do not use a Button to **navigate** to another page or screen; use a Link (or a Link styled as a button) so the destination is exposed to assistive technology and works with open-in-new-tab. Do not use more than one `primary` button in the same region — if everything is emphasized, nothing is. Do not use `disabled` to communicate *why* an action is unavailable; prefer keeping the button enabled and explaining the problem on activation, or show the reason inline.

## Behavior

Activation fires `onPress` exactly once per pointer click, Enter key, Space key, or assistive-technology activation. While `loading` is true the button announces itself as busy and ignores further activation, but keeps its size so the layout does not shift. `disabled` buttons remain focusable so that keyboard and screen-reader users can discover them; they are announced as "dimmed" or "disabled" and do not fire `onPress`.

## Content guidelines

Labels are sentence case, one to three words, and start with a verb. Avoid "Yes"/"No"; restate the action ("Delete file" / "Keep file"). Icon-only buttons must set `label` to what the button does, not what the icon depicts ("Close", not "X").

## Accessibility

Every button must have an accessible name (WCAG 4.1.2). The name comes from the visible label or, for `iconOnly`, from the `label` prop rendered as `aria-label` / `accessibilityLabel`. Focus must be visible (WCAG 2.4.7 and 2.4.11): the focus ring uses `color.border.focus` at `border.width.focus` and is never removed without a replacement. The interactive target is at least 24×24 CSS px (WCAG 2.5.8, AA) at every `size`, and 44×44 on touch platforms following iOS and Android guidelines. Text and background pairs for every variant meet 4.5:1 (WCAG 1.4.3) in both light and dark themes — the build checks this against the tokens. Buttons are activated with Enter and Space, and never rely on hover alone to convey state.

## Platform notes

### Web
Render a native `<button>` with `type` from the prop (default `button`, so a button inside a form never submits by accident). Use `aria-disabled="true"` for the disabled state; the button stays in the tab order. Set `aria-busy="true"` while loading.

### Lit
The host element `<ds-button>` reflects `variant`, `size`, `disabled`, `icon-only` and `loading` as attributes so consumers can style states from outside the shadow root. The inner element is a real `<button>`; the shadow root is created with `delegatesFocus: true`. Activation dispatches a composed, bubbling `press` CustomEvent. Consumers can also listen to the native `click` that bubbles out of the shadow root.

### React Native
Render a `Pressable` with `accessibilityRole="button"`, `accessibilityLabel={label}` and `accessibilityState={{ disabled, busy: loading }}`. There is no CSS cascade, so every style binding is applied explicitly from the token object. Because there is no hover on touch, `backgroundHover` is used for the pressed state. Icons passed as `leadingIcon`/`trailingIcon` are rendered as given: there is no cascade, so Button cannot recolor them, and callers color glyphs with the variant's foreground themselves until an Icon component exists. When the visual footprint is smaller than 44px, add `hitSlop` to reach the comfortable target size.

## Extensions

The schema above already includes what these extensions add (items marked `source: extensions/...`). Implement them like any other prop, event, binding, copy string, keyboard rule or scenario.

### analytics — `extensions/Button.analytics.md`

Product analytics needs to know which buttons people press, without every screen wiring its own handler and without the generated Button knowing which analytics vendor is in use. `track` names the event; when it is set, a press calls the hand-written `trackPress` module with the event name and the button's visible label, then fires `onTrack` with the same pair so a screen can react (a toast, a redirect) without touching analytics itself.

The module is the seam. `packages/<platform>/src/custom/analytics.ts` is owned by the adopter: in development it logs the pair to the console; in production it is a no-op until someone points it at a vendor SDK. The generated component imports `trackPress` from `./custom/analytics` and calls it exactly once per press, after `onPress` and before `onTrack`, only when `track` is set. It never reads or rewrites the module body, and a press with no `track` is exactly the upstream Button.

**Hand-written modules** — import and call them exactly as stated; never create, edit or copy anything under `src/custom/`:

- `import { trackPress } from './custom/analytics';` — signature `(name: string, label: string) => void`. Called from onPress when `track` is set, before onTrack fires.
