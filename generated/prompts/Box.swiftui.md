# Generate: Box for SwiftUI (iOS)

You are generating a production component for the **Design Schema** design system. The component schema below is the source of truth. Do not invent props, events, or styles that are not in it, and do not omit any that are.

## Output

Write `packages/swiftui/Sources/DesignSchema/Box.swift` declaring `public struct Box: View` with a public initializer whose parameters are the schema's props **in the schema's order** (doc defaults as default arguments), then the event closures in the schema's order, then `overrides:`; nested `public enum`s for enum props (`String` raw values equal to the doc values, case names the values camel-cased — `icon-only` → `iconOnly` — with leading digits moved to the end, `2xl` → `xl2`, since nothing else is a Swift identifier); `public struct`s for `array`/`object` shapes named from the shape; closures for events named per `platforms.swiftui`; and `#Preview` blocks. That order and those names are a contract: `tools/behavior_tests.ts` writes `Tests/DesignSchemaTests/Generated/BoxBehaviorTests.swift` from the doc's `behavior` block and calls this initializer directly. Beside it write `packages/swiftui/Sources/DesignSchema/Gallery+Box.swift`: `public extension Gallery { static var <name>Screen: GalleryEntry { GalleryEntry("Box") { … } } }`, one gallery screen showing the component in its states, where `<name>Screen` is the component name with a lower-case first letter. Never edit `Support/Gallery+Generated.swift` — the generator rewrites that list from the screen files.

## Rules

- Render the SwiftUI view declared under `platforms.swiftui.element` with the modifiers listed under `platforms.swiftui.props`. Map each event to its `platforms.swiftui` name.
- Read tokens from `@Environment(\.dsTheme)` (`DesignSchemaTokens`). Colors are `Color`, dimensions `CGFloat` points, durations `TimeInterval`, easings `Animation`, font weights `Font.Weight`, line heights unitless multipliers. Never hard-code a color, size, font or duration. A style binding like `color.action.{variant}.background` becomes a lookup keyed by the enum value.
- Implement every item in `a11y.requires` with SwiftUI's accessibility API:
  - `accessible-name`: `.accessibilityLabel(label)`; a visually hidden label is still the label.
  - `keyboard-operable` / `focus-visible`: `.focusable()` where the doc's keyboard table applies, `@FocusState` for the roving index, `.dsOnKeyPress` (the package's own wrapper around `.onKeyPress(keys:)`, so the behavior gate can reach the same handler) / `.onMoveCommand` / `.onExitCommand` for the keys, and the focus ring drawn from `focusRing`/`focusRingWidth` only for keyboard focus.
  - `target-24px` / `target-44px`: `.frame(minWidth: theme.sizeTargetMin, minHeight: …)` (or `sizeTargetComfortable`) plus `.contentShape(Rectangle())`.
  - `heading-hierarchy`: `.accessibilityAddTraits(.isHeader)`; `.accessibilityHeading(.h1…h6)` from the level prop.
  - `live-region`: `AccessibilityNotification.Announcement`.
  - `reduced-motion`: `@Environment(\.accessibilityReduceMotion)` disables every animation the doc names.
  - `selected-state` / `expanded-state`: `.isSelected` trait or `.accessibilityValue("expanded"/"collapsed")`.
  - `gesture-alternative`: every gesture has a visible control and an `.accessibilityAction`.
- `disabled` uses `opacity.disabled` on the whole element, `.accessibilityRespondsToUserInteraction(false)` and a press guard; never `.disabled(true)` unless the doc says the control leaves the focus order.
- `content` props are `@ViewBuilder` generic closures. Enum props whose values are quoted digits (Heading `level`, Stack `gap`) accept `Int` as well.
- Use every `copy.*` string verbatim through `String(localized:)`-ready constants; do not write your own user-facing text.
- Testability hooks: `.accessibilityIdentifier("Box")` on the root and `"Box.<part>"` on every anatomy part, names verbatim. The generated behavior tests find everything through them and assert against the accessibility tree, so a state the doc names has to be visible there: `expanded` as `.accessibilityValue("expanded")`/`("collapsed")`, `selected` as `.isSelected`, `disabled` as an element that reports itself not enabled.
- `keyboard` rules describe the web keyboard model; implement the subset an iPad hardware keyboard can reach and expose everything else through accessibility actions and visible controls. Overlays follow the conventions (sheet / fullScreenCover / popover / confirmationDialog / Menu).
- Props of type `array`, `object`, or `function` carry a `shape` string in TypeScript notation; translate it to a Swift `struct`/closure type with the same member names. `ReactNode` is a `@ViewBuilder` closure or `AnyView`.
- Interpolated style bindings (`color.status.{tone}.background`) resolve per enum value at render time; a resolved path ending in `.default` drops that segment; an enum value of `none` for a background/border/max-width binding renders nothing rather than a token.
- Composite components reuse the system's existing views (`Button`, `Link`, `Text`, `Heading`, `Icon`, `Stack`) from the package rather than re-implementing them, and never restyle a child: if a child needs a variation, the child's schema grows.
- Transitions use the component's own `transition` binding with `motion.easing.standard`; `motion.duration.fast` is only the default when a component has no `transition` binding.
- Development-only warnings use `#if DEBUG`.
- Previews are named after the prop and value in PascalCase (`ToneInfo`, `RoleBanner`).
- Icons: use `Icon(name:)` for every glyph the docs name; never draw a glyph inline and never use SF Symbols.
- Swift 6 strict concurrency: value-type views, `@MainActor` only around UIKit calls, no `@unchecked Sendable`.

## Declared contracts

The sections between the schema and the overrides resolve what the schema declares for swiftui; a section is absent when the component declares none of it. Where one disagrees with prose or a rule above, the section wins.

- **Events**: each closure takes exactly the listed arguments, in order, and `reason` is a nested `enum` of its reasons. A `cancelable` closure returns `Bool`, and `false` skips the default action. Fire only for the listed `fires` sources, in the `timing` order given.
- **Controlled state**: every pair becomes a `Binding<T>?` parameter plus the default's initial value, with `@State` holding the uncontrolled value; the closure fires in both modes, and a bound view shows the new state only once the binding changes.
- **Parts and slots**: each slot is a `@ViewBuilder` parameter under its resolved label only (`content` for the default slot). A composed part receives exactly the listed `props`, and each forward reaches the child's `overrides:` under the child binding named; add no other.
- **Style bindings**: a binding styles the view for its `part`, only in its `state` (`.onHover`, `@FocusState`, or the view's own state), with the token listed for each `by` value; write `computed` as the given multiplication of `theme` values. Never introduce a literal: the literal gate still applies.
- **Keyboard**: implement the listed rules as written and none the section excludes; `target` is the part that opens or closes, `repeat` the presses, and a `native` rule needs no code. A rule with `given` applies when those props are set.
- **Form and overlay**: a field registers through the one form contract `discovery` names, submitting `value` as `valueType` under `name` and running `validation` in order with the `messages` copy. An overlay anchors to `anchor`, reads `placement`, dismisses exactly by `dismiss` through `closeEvent`, and is modal only when `modal` is true; this picks among the conventions' overlay forms.
- **Copy**: interpolate only the listed `params` and props; select plural forms through `String(localized:)` with the entry's forms as its plural variations; never concatenate a count into a sentence.
- **Constants and examples**: logic reads each constant through its token expression, never the number it resolves to today. Every example becomes a `#Preview` with the name shown and exactly its `given`.
- **Lifecycle**: a deprecated parameter, closure, case or view keeps working, is marked `@available(*, deprecated, message:)` naming `use`, and warns once under `#if DEBUG` naming `use`.
- A `type: integer` prop is an `Int`: whole numbers only.

        itself is a single-child wrapper (`VStack(spacing: 0)`) and never spaces siblings.
        No accessibility semantics unless the doc says the role is a landmark (then
        see Landmark).'
```

## Overrides (per-instance styling contract)

The component accepts `overrides: [Binding: TokenRef] = [:]` where `Binding` is a nested `public enum Binding: String, CaseIterable` listing the overridable bindings below and `TokenRef` is the token-name enum generated into `DesignSchemaTokens`. Resolve each entry with `theme[ref]` and use the typed result in place of the binding's default token. This is the ONLY per-instance styling surface: there is no style modifier parameter, so a screen cannot drift from the system by passing points. Locked bindings are not cases of `Binding`.

Overrides change values, never presence: a prop that turns a part off (`surface: none`, `border: false`, `radius: none`) makes the matching overrides no-ops; apply an override only where the binding is in effect.

Overridable: `paddingBlock`, `paddingInline`, `border`, `borderWidth`, `radius`
Locked (accessibility-bearing, never overridable): `background`

## Platform notes (swiftui)

```yaml
element: VStack
props:
- .padding
- .background
- .overlay=border
- .clipShape
- .frame=maxWidth
- .accessibilityElement=contain
notes: 'A layout container: `padding` from the inset token on all edges, `.background(RoundedRectangle)`
  in the surface color (nothing for `none`), a stroked overlay for `border`, `.clipShape`
  for radius. Children are laid out by the caller''s stack; Box itself is a single-child
  wrapper (`VStack(spacing: 0)`) and never spaces siblings. No accessibility semantics
  unless the doc says the role is a landmark (then see Landmark).'
```

## Guidance

## Overview

Box is the thing you reach for when a group of content needs a surface: padding around it, a background under it, a border, rounded corners. It has no opinions about what is inside and no spacing between its children — that is Stack's job — so the two compose without overlap: a Box for the inset, a Stack for the gaps.

## When to use

Use a Box to give a region of a layout a background or padding: a sidebar panel, a highlighted row, a footer band, the inside of a modal. Use it when a Card is too much (a Card is a Box with conventions about elevation and content). Choose `inset` by role — `sm` for dense rows, `md` for most panels, `lg` for page-level containers, `xl` for hero bands — and let the theme's rhythm decide the numbers.

## When not to use

Do not use a Box to add space between two components; put them in a Stack. Do not use it as a page container; Container owns gutters and measure. Do not nest surfaces more than two deep (`subtle` on `default`, `strong` on `subtle`) — a third level reads as clutter and the contrast math is only checked two deep. Do not use `surface` to signal status; that is Alert's tinted background.

## Behavior

Box renders its children in a block with the requested padding, background, border and radius, and nothing else. It adds no role of its own (`a11y.role: none`); when `element` is `section`, `article`, `aside` or `nav`, the native element carries that semantics on web, and Lit sets the matching ElementInternals role. It never scrolls, never clips (`radius` does not imply `overflow: hidden`; a child that should be clipped clips itself), and never carries margin. `insetBlock` and `insetInline` override `inset` per axis. `surface: none` sets no background at all, so the parent's shows through.

## Content guidelines

None; Box has no text of its own.

## Accessibility

Box is invisible to assistive technology unless `element` gives it a sectioning role, in which case Landmark is usually the right component instead. Text on a `subtle` or `strong` surface must remain readable: the build checks body, muted and link foreground against both surfaces in both modes (WCAG 1.4.3), which is what makes "two levels deep" a safe rule rather than a hope. A border, when present, is decorative; nothing relies on it to identify content (1.4.11 does not apply).

## Platform notes

### Web
Render the `element` with classes `ds-box`, `ds-box--inset-{value}`, `ds-box--inset-block-{value}`, `ds-box--inset-inline-{value}`, `ds-box--surface-{value}`, `ds-box--border`, `ds-box--radius-{value}`. Padding uses logical properties (`padding-block`, `padding-inline`). Axis modifiers are declared after the all-sides modifier so they win.

### Lit
`<ds-box inset="md" surface="subtle" radius="md">`. The host is the box; `:host` carries the padding, background, border and radius from reflected attributes (`:host([inset="md"])`). Children are slotted. `element` maps to a role on the host through `ElementInternals` for the sectioning values and is otherwise inert.

### React Native
`View` with `paddingVertical`/`paddingHorizontal` from `layout.inset.*`, `backgroundColor` from `color.background.*` (undefined for `none`), `borderWidth`/`borderColor` when `border`, `borderRadius` from `radius.*`. No `element`.
