# Generate: Breadcrumb for SwiftUI (iOS)

You are generating a production component for the **Design Schema** design system. The component schema below is the source of truth. Do not invent props, events, or styles that are not in it, and do not omit any that are.

## Output

Write `packages/swiftui/Sources/DesignSchema/Breadcrumb.swift` declaring `public struct Breadcrumb: View` with a public initializer whose parameters are the schema's props **in the schema's order** (doc defaults as default arguments), then the event closures in the schema's order, then `overrides:`; nested `public enum`s for enum props (`String` raw values equal to the doc values, case names the values camel-cased — `icon-only` → `iconOnly` — with leading digits moved to the end, `2xl` → `xl2`, since nothing else is a Swift identifier); `public struct`s for `array`/`object` shapes named from the shape; closures for events named per `platforms.swiftui`; and `#Preview` blocks. That order and those names are a contract: `tools/behavior_tests.ts` writes `Tests/DesignSchemaTests/Generated/BreadcrumbBehaviorTests.swift` from the doc's `behavior` block and calls this initializer directly. Beside it write `packages/swiftui/Sources/DesignSchema/Gallery+Breadcrumb.swift`: `public extension Gallery { static var <name>Screen: GalleryEntry { GalleryEntry("Breadcrumb") { … } } }`, one gallery screen showing the component in its states, where `<name>Screen` is the component name with a lower-case first letter. Never edit `Support/Gallery+Generated.swift` — the generator rewrites that list from the screen files.

## Rules

- Render the SwiftUI view declared under `platforms.swiftui.element` with the modifiers listed under `platforms.swiftui.props`. Map each event to its `platforms.swiftui` name.
- Read tokens from `@Environment(\.dsTheme)` (`DesignSchemaTokens`). Colors are `Color`, dimensions `CGFloat` points, durations `TimeInterval`, easings `Animation`, font weights `Font.Weight`, line heights unitless multipliers. Never hard-code a color, size, font or duration. A style binding like `color.action.{variant}.background` becomes a lookup keyed by the enum value.
- Implement every item in `a11y.requires` with SwiftUI's accessibility API:
  - `accessible-name`: `.accessibilityLabel(label)`; a visually hidden label is still the label.
  - `keyboard-operable` / `focus-visible`: `.focusable()` where the doc's keyboard table applies, `@FocusState` for the roving index, `.dsOnKeyPress` (the package's own wrapper around `.onKeyPress(keys:)`, so the behavior gate can reach the same handler) / `.onMoveCommand` / `.onExitCommand` for the keys, and the focus ring drawn from `focusRing`/`focusRingWidth` only for keyboard focus.
  - `target-24px` / `target-44px`: `.frame(minWidth: theme.sizeTargetMin, minHeight: …)` (or `sizeTargetComfortable`) plus `.contentShape(Rectangle())`.
  - `heading-hierarchy`: `.accessibilityAddTraits(.isHeader)`; `.accessibilityHeading(.h1…h6)` from the level prop.
  - `live-region`: `AccessibilityNotification.Announcement`.
  - `reduced-motion`: `@Environment(\.accessibilityReduceMotion)` disables every animation the doc names.
  - `selected-state` / `expanded-state`: `.isSelected` trait or `.accessibilityValue("expanded"/"collapsed")`.
  - `gesture-alternative`: every gesture has a visible control and an `.accessibilityAction`.
- `disabled` uses `opacity.disabled` on the whole element, `.accessibilityRespondsToUserInteraction(false)` and a press guard; never `.disabled(true)` unless the doc says the control leaves the focus order.
- `content` props are `@ViewBuilder` generic closures. Enum props whose values are quoted digits (Heading `level`, Stack `gap`) accept `Int` as well.
- Use every `copy.*` string verbatim through `String(localized:)`-ready constants; do not write your own user-facing text.
- Testability hooks: `.accessibilityIdentifier("Breadcrumb")` on the root and `"Breadcrumb.<part>"` on every anatomy part, names verbatim. The generated behavior tests find everything through them and assert against the accessibility tree, so a state the doc names has to be visible there: `expanded` as `.accessibilityValue("expanded")`/`("collapsed")`, `selected` as `.isSelected`, `disabled` as an element that reports itself not enabled.
- `keyboard` rules describe the web keyboard model; implement the subset an iPad hardware keyboard can reach and expose everything else through accessibility actions and visible controls. Overlays follow the conventions (sheet / fullScreenCover / popover / confirmationDialog / Menu).
- Props of type `array`, `object`, or `function` carry a `shape` string in TypeScript notation; translate it to a Swift `struct`/closure type with the same member names. `ReactNode` is a `@ViewBuilder` closure or `AnyView`.
- Interpolated style bindings (`color.status.{tone}.background`) resolve per enum value at render time; a resolved path ending in `.default` drops that segment; an enum value of `none` for a background/border/max-width binding renders nothing rather than a token.
- Composite components reuse the system's existing views (`Button`, `Link`, `Text`, `Heading`, `Icon`, `Stack`) from the package rather than re-implementing them, and never restyle a child: if a child needs a variation, the child's schema grows.
- Transitions use the component's own `transition` binding with `motion.easing.standard`; `motion.duration.fast` is only the default when a component has no `transition` binding.
- Development-only warnings use `#if DEBUG`.
- Previews are named after the prop and value in PascalCase (`ToneInfo`, `RoleBanner`).
- Icons: use `Icon(name:)` for every glyph the docs name; never draw a glyph inline and never use SF Symbols.
- Swift 6 strict concurrency: value-type views, `@MainActor` only around UIKit calls, no `@unchecked Sendable`.

## Declared contracts

The sections between the schema and the overrides resolve what the schema declares for swiftui; a section is absent when the component declares none of it. Where one disagrees with prose or a rule above, the section wins.

- **Events**: each closure takes exactly the listed arguments, in order, and `reason` is a nested `enum` of its reasons. A `cancelable` closure returns `Bool`, and `false` skips the default action. Fire only for the listed `fires` sources, in the `timing` order given.
- **Controlled state**: every pair becomes a `Binding<T>?` parameter plus the default's initial value, with `@State` holding the uncontrolled value; the closure fires in both modes, and a bound view shows the new state only once the binding changes.
- **Parts and slots**: each slot is a `@ViewBuilder` parameter under its resolved label only (`content` for the default slot). A composed part receives exactly the listed `props`, and each forward reaches the child's `overrides:` under the child binding named; add no other.
- **Style bindings**: a binding styles the view for its `part`, only in its `state` (`.onHover`, `@FocusState`, or the view's own state), with the token listed for each `by` value; write `computed` as the given multiplication of `theme` values. Never introduce a literal: the literal gate still applies.
- **Keyboard**: implement the listed rules as written and none the section excludes; `target` is the part that opens or closes, `repeat` the presses, and a `native` rule needs no code. A rule with `given` applies when those props are set.
- **Form and overlay**: a field registers through the one form contract `discovery` names, submitting `value` as `valueType` under `name` and running `validation` in order with the `messages` copy. An overlay anchors to `anchor`, reads `placement`, dismisses exactly by `dismiss` through `closeEvent`, and is modal only when `modal` is true; this picks among the conventions' overlay forms.
- **Copy**: interpolate only the listed `params` and props; select plural forms through `String(localized:)` with the entry's forms as its plural variations; never concatenate a count into a sentence.
- **Constants and examples**: logic reads each constant through its token expression, never the number it resolves to today. Every example becomes a `#Preview` with the name shown and exactly its `given`.
- **Lifecycle**: a deprecated parameter, closure, case or view keeps working, is marked `@available(*, deprecated, message:)` naming `use`, and warns once under `#if DEBUG` naming `use`.
- A `type: integer` prop is an `Int`: whole numbers only.

        `copy.current` in its label. `collapse` folds the middle items behind an ellipsis
        Button that expands them in place.'
```

## Overrides (per-instance styling contract)

The component accepts `overrides: [Binding: TokenRef] = [:]` where `Binding` is a nested `public enum Binding: String, CaseIterable` listing the overridable bindings below and `TokenRef` is the token-name enum generated into `DesignSchemaTokens`. Resolve each entry with `theme[ref]` and use the typed result in place of the binding's default token. This is the ONLY per-instance styling surface: there is no style modifier parameter, so a screen cannot drift from the system by passing points. Locked bindings are not cases of `Binding`.

Overrides change values, never presence: a prop that turns a part off (`surface: none`, `border: false`, `radius: none`) makes the matching overrides no-ops; apply an override only where the binding is in effect.

Overridable: `gap`, `fontFamily`, `fontSize`, `fontWeight`, `lineHeight`
Locked (accessibility-bearing, never overridable): `currentColor`, `itemColor`, `separatorColor`, `minTarget`

## Platform notes (swiftui)

  in its label. `collapse` folds the middle items behind an ellipsis Button that expands
  them in place.'

## Guidance

## Overview

A breadcrumb answers "where am I?" and "how do I go up a level?" in one line. It is a secondary navigation: it never replaces the primary nav or the back button, and it shows the site's hierarchy, not the user's history.

## When to use

Use a Breadcrumb on pages that live three or more levels deep in a hierarchy — documentation, catalogues, settings sub-pages, file browsers — where the user benefits from seeing the ancestors and jumping to any of them. Place it above the page title, at the top of `main`.

## When not to use

Do not use a Breadcrumb on top-level pages or in flat sites; a single-item trail is noise. Do not use it to show history ("you came from Search"); that is what Back is for. Do not use it as a step indicator for a wizard (use Stepper, planned); steps are not places. Do not put actions in it.

## Behavior

Each ancestor is a Link that navigates on activation and fires `onNavigate` with the item first, so client-side routers can intercept. The last item is the current page: plain text with `aria-current="page"`, not focusable. With `collapse` and more than four items, the trail shows the first item, an ellipsis button labelled `copy.expandLabel`, and the last two; activating the ellipsis replaces it with the hidden items (one-way; the trail does not re-collapse) and moves focus to the first revealed link. On narrow widths the trail wraps rather than truncating so every ancestor stays reachable.

## Content guidelines

Item labels are the page titles of the ancestors, shortened if they are long, and always in the same order as the site structure. The root item is the section or product name ("Docs", "Catalogue"), not "Home", unless the trail really starts at the home page. Do not repeat the current page's title in the trail if the page heading is directly below and the trail is long; but when in doubt, include it — the APG expects the current page as the last item.

## Accessibility

The breadcrumb is a `navigation` landmark with a name that distinguishes it from other navigations (WCAG 1.3.1, 2.4.8, APG breadcrumb). Items are in an ordered list so the count and order are announced. Ancestors are real links with visible underline and focus ring (2.4.4, 2.4.7); the current page carries `aria-current="page"` and is not a link, so users are not offered a link to where they already are. Separators are hidden from assistive technology (they are visual punctuation) and the ellipsis is a real button with an accessible name. Link, current and separator colors all meet 4.5:1 on the page background.

## Platform notes

### Web
Render `<nav aria-label={label}><ol>` with `<li>` per item. Ancestors render the system `Link` (`tone: default`, inheriting the nav's `fontSize`); the last renders `<span aria-current="page">`. Draw separators with `li + li::before { content: var(--ds-breadcrumb-separator) }` in `separatorColor`, so they are invisible to assistive technology. The ellipsis is the system `Button` (`ghost`, `size: sm`, `iconOnly`, `label: copy.expandLabel`, a three-dot glyph as `leadingIcon`). Call `onNavigate(item, index, event)` from the link's `onClick` before the default navigation; consumers routing client-side call `event.preventDefault()` on that event. Link and Button bring their own focus rings; Breadcrumb adds none.

### Lit
`<ds-breadcrumb .items=${items}>` renders the `<nav>`, list and `<ds-link>` elements in its shadow root. Landmarks inside shadow roots are exposed normally. Dispatch a composed `navigate` CustomEvent with `detail: { item, index }` from the inner link's click; consumers who route client-side call `preventDefault()` on the retargeted native click. Reflect `collapse`.

### React Native
Render a `View` with `flexDirection: 'row'`, `flexWrap: 'wrap'`, `accessibilityLabel={label}` and `role="navigation"` (semantic on react-native-web, ignored on native). Ancestors are the system `Link` nested in a `Text` at `fontSize` so they inherit it, with `onPress` calling `onNavigate(item, index)`; each item sits in a `View` with `minHeight: minTarget`. Focus after expanding goes to the revealed items' container via `setAccessibilityFocus` (hardware-keyboard focus cannot be moved to a Text link); the current page is `Text` in `currentColor` with `accessibilityState={{ selected: true }}`; separators are `Text` in `separatorColor` with `accessibilityElementsHidden` and `importantForAccessibility="no"`. The ellipsis is the system `Button` (`ghost`, `iconOnly`).
