# Generate: Landmark as a Lit web component

You are generating a production component for the **Design Schema** design system. The component schema below is the source of truth. Do not invent props, events, or styles that are not in it, and do not omit any that are.

## Output

Write `packages/lit/src/Landmark.ts` defining the custom element tag declared under `platforms.lit.tag` (a `LitElement` subclass), exporting the class and registering it with `customElements.define`. Add a `Landmark.stories.ts` covering every enum value of every enum prop.

## Rules

- Lit 3.3 with standard (TC39) decorators: each schema prop becomes a `@property()` auto-accessor — `@property({ type: String, reflect: true }) accessor variant: LandmarkVariant = 'primary'` — never a plain decorated field (`experimentalDecorators` is off). Props listed under `platforms.lit.reflect` use `reflect: true` so they can be styled from outside with attribute selectors. Boolean props are boolean attributes (`type: Boolean`). Internal state is `@state() private accessor open = false`.
- Each event is dispatched as a `CustomEvent` named by its `platforms.lit` value with `bubbles: true, composed: true` so it crosses the shadow boundary.
- Styles live in `static override styles: CSSResult = css\`…\`` and read ONLY token custom properties (`var(--color-…)`), which inherit through the shadow root. Never hard-code a color, size, or font. A style binding like `color.action.{variant}.background` becomes an attribute selector per enum value, e.g. `:host([variant="primary"]) { background: var(--color-action-primary-background); }`.
- Implement every item in `a11y.requires` inside the shadow DOM using a native element (e.g. a real `<button>`), and use `delegatesFocus: true` in `static override shadowRootOptions: ShadowRootInit` so focusing the host focuses the inner element.
- `accessible-name`: forward `label` to visible text or `aria-label` on the inner element.
- `focus-visible`: style `:focus-visible` on the inner element with `--color-border-focus` / `--border-width-focus`.
- `heading-hierarchy`: render the matching `<h1>`–`<h6>` inside the shadow root based on the level prop.
- Support light and dark by relying on token variables only.
- Form ownership is DOM-tree based: slotted light-DOM children are not owned by a `<form>` inside a shadow root. Follow the platform notes for how ds-form and ds-input cooperate by `name`.
- Events named like native events (`focus`, `blur`) are the native retargeted events — do not dispatch a CustomEvent with the same name.
- `disabled` uses `opacity.disabled`; transitions use `motion.duration.fast` + `motion.easing.standard`, removed under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Use every `copy.*` string verbatim; do not write your own user-facing text.
- Testability hooks for the gates: the host carries `data-ds="<Name>"`; a component with a `keyboard` block ships a story exported as `Keyboard` that renders it open/present with its trigger (if any) and at least three focusable children.
- `keyboard` rules are the keyboard model: implement every key → action exactly as listed and nothing else; `composition` parts must render the named system element. Overlays: a modal dialog uses a native `<dialog>` inside the shadow root opened with `showModal()` (native focus trap, `inert` background and top layer); non-modal popups use the Popover API (`popover="manual"`, `showPopover()`) when available and a `position: fixed` fallback, positioned from the trigger and flipped at the viewport edge; body scroll is locked while a modal is open; focus returns to the opener on close; stacking uses `z-index: var(--layer-<name>)` inside the top layer.
- Props of type `array`, `object`, or `function` carry a `shape` string in TypeScript notation; use it verbatim as the type. Prop type `content` is `ReactNode` / a slot / `ReactNode` by platform.
- Interpolated style bindings (`color.status.{tone}.background`) resolve per enum value at render time; never enumerate them by hand where a lookup will do. A resolved path ending in `.default` drops that segment (`color.background.{surface}` with `default` is `color.background`, i.e. `--color-background` / `colorBackground`); an enum value of `none` for a background/border/max-width binding renders nothing rather than a token.
- Composite components (Breadcrumb, Alert, RadioGroup) reuse the system's existing components (Link, Button, Text) from the same package rather than re-implementing them, and never restyle a child (no class overrides, no `::part`, no style props reaching into it): if a child needs a variation, the child's schema grows.
- Transitions use the component's own `transition` binding (its token and description), with `motion.easing.standard`; `motion.duration.fast` is only the default when a component has no `transition` binding.
- Development-only warnings the docs ask for use the platform convention: `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'` (React), `import.meta.env.DEV` (Lit), `__DEV__` (React Native).
- Stories are named after the prop and value in PascalCase (`ToneInfo`, `RoleBanner`); demo stories are titled `Demo/<Name>/<Platform>`.
- Icons: use the system `Icon` component for every glyph the docs name (`<Icon name="external" inline />`, `<ds-icon name="close">`, `<Icon name="check" color={…} />`); never draw an inline SVG or a Unicode glyph by hand. Decorative icons take no label; a glyph that carries meaning gets one.
- Stories: Storybook 10 CSF3 with `@storybook/web-components-vite` and `html` from lit; title `'<Name>/Lit'`; one story per enum value plus Default.
- TypeScript 7 with `isolatedDeclarations`: every exported symbol carries an explicit type annotation and no export type is inferred — `protected override render(): TemplateResult` (`TemplateResult | typeof nothing` when a branch renders nothing), typed static members, public methods with return types, `const meta: Meta = …` in stories. `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` (`name?: T | undefined`), `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and `verbatimModuleSyntax` (`import type`) are on.
- Tests run on Vitest 5 browser mode over Vite 8 (Playwright, Chromium; helpers from `vitest/browser`); the behavior scenarios below become `Landmark.test.ts`.

## Declared contracts

The sections between the schema and the overrides resolve what the schema declares for lit; a section is absent when the component declares none of it. Where one disagrees with prose or a rule above, the section wins.

- **Events**: dispatch each as a `CustomEvent` under its emitted name whose `detail` has exactly the listed keys, and type `reason` as the union of its reasons. A `cancelable` event is dispatched with `cancelable: true`, and the element skips the default action when `dispatchEvent` returns `false`. Fire only for the listed `fires` sources, in the `timing` order given.
- **Controlled state**: implement every pair: controlled when the property is set, uncontrolled from the default property otherwise (`@state`), the event fired in both modes; a controlled element shows the new state only once the property changes.
- **Parts and slots**: render each slot only as `<slot>` under its resolved name (the default slot unnamed). A composed part receives exactly the listed `props`, and each forward reaches the child's `overrides` under the child binding named; add no other.
- **Style bindings**: a binding styles its `part` (the `data-part` element in the shadow root), only in its `state` (`:hover`, `:focus-visible`, the reflected state attribute), with the token listed for each `by` value; write `computed` as the given `calc()`. Never introduce a literal: the literal gate still applies.
- **Keyboard**: implement the listed rules as written and none the section excludes; `target` is the part that opens or closes, `repeat` the presses, and a `native` rule needs no code. A rule with `given` needs the `Keyboard` story to accept those args from the story URL shown.
- **Form and overlay**: a field registers through the one form contract `discovery` names, submitting `value` as `valueType` under `name` and running `validation` in order with the `messages` copy. An overlay anchors to `anchor`, reads `placement`, handles overflow by `collision`, dismisses exactly by `dismiss` through `closeEvent`, and is modal only when `modal` is true; this replaces the overlay defaults above.
- **Copy**: interpolate only the listed `params` and props; select a plural form with `new Intl.PluralRules(locale).select(count)`; never concatenate a count into a sentence.
- **Constants and examples**: logic reads each constant through its token expression, never the number it resolves to today. Every example is a story with the name shown and exactly its `given` as args.
- **Lifecycle**: a deprecated property, event, value or element keeps working, carries a `@deprecated` JSDoc tag naming `use`, and warns once in development (`import.meta.env.DEV`) naming `use`.
- A `type: integer` prop accepts whole numbers only: type it `number` and never produce a fraction.

## Constants and examples

- example `page-main`, story `PageMain`: given `role: "main"`, `children: "The page content."`; The single main landmark every page needs.
- example `footer-navigation`, story `FooterNavigation`: given `role: "navigation"`, `label: "Footer"`, `children: "Footer links."`; A second navigation, named so it is distinguishable from the primary one.
- example `related-articles-region`, story `RelatedArticlesRegion`: given `role: "region"`, `label: "Related articles"`, `children: "A list of related articles."`; A labelled section that deserves a jump point of its own.

## Overrides (per-instance styling contract)

Every style binding above becomes a CSS custom-property hook on `:host`, named `--ds-<tag-without-prefix>-<binding>` (kebab-case), defaulting to its token: `:host {{ --ds-button-padding-inline: var(--space-md) }}` and rules read `var(--ds-button-padding-inline)`, never the token directly. Interpolated bindings set the hook per reflected attribute (`:host([variant="primary"]) {{ --ds-button-background: var(--color-action-primary-background) }}`). Because document styles on the host beat `:host` rules, consumers can override from CSS (`ds-button.hero {{ --ds-button-padding-inline: var(--space-lg) }}`) — that is the sanctioned escape hatch.

The element also has an `overrides` property (`attribute: false`, `Partial<Record<OverridableBinding, TokenRef>>`, `TokenRef` from `@design-schema/tokens`) that sets the hooks with `this.style.setProperty(hook, 'var(--<token-kebab>)')`. Locked bindings are not in the type and are ignored. No `::part` is exposed for styling.

Overrides change values, never presence: a prop that turns a part off (`surface: none`, `border: false`, `radius: none`) makes the matching overrides no-ops; apply an override only where the binding is in effect.

Overridable: none
Locked (accessibility-bearing, never overridable): none

## Behavior scenarios (10)

Each scenario below becomes one test. They are platform-neutral: `given` are prop overrides on the `Default` story's args, `when` is one interaction, `then` is a list of expectations. Scenarios marked `derived` were produced by the parser from the schema; the rest were written in the doc. Render every scenario; never skip one because the component does not satisfy it. A scenario the code fails is a failing test, and a scenario that cannot be expressed on this platform is a gap to report, not a test to delete.

## Guidance

## Overview

Landmarks are the page's table of contents for assistive technology. A screen-reader user arriving on a page presses one key to jump to the main content, another to list the navigations, another for the search. Without landmarks they read from the top. This component exists so that every page in the system gets the same, correct set of them without anyone remembering which element implies which role.

## When to use

Wrap the page's major regions in a Landmark: one `banner` for the site header, one `main` for the primary content, `navigation` for each navigation block (labelled when there is more than one), `complementary` for sidebars that make sense on their own, `contentinfo` for the site footer, `search` around the site search form, and `region` for any other section a user might want to jump to — a "Related articles" block, a dashboard panel. Every page should have exactly one `main`.

## When not to use

Do not wrap everything: a page with twenty landmarks is as hard to navigate as one with none. Layout containers, cards, list items and form groups are not landmarks; use Stack, Fieldset (planned), or nothing. Do not use `region` without a `label` — an unlabelled region is not exposed as a landmark and the component will warn. Do not use Landmark to style a region; it has no visual bindings by design.

## Behavior

Landmark renders its children inside the appropriate element with the appropriate role and name, and nothing else: no padding, background, or layout. It is transparent to layout on every platform (`display: contents` is *not* used, because it removes the element's semantics in some browsers; instead the element is a plain block and consumers lay it out like any block). In development, the component warns when `main` appears more than once in a document, when `region` or `form` has no `label`, and when two `navigation`, `complementary`, `region` or `form` landmarks in the same root share a label or both lack one (`banner`, `main` and `contentinfo` never take labels). On native there is no document to scan, so only the missing-label warning applies.

## Content guidelines

Labels name the region in one or two words and do not repeat the role: "Main" and "Footer" for two navigations (read as "Main navigation"), not "Main navigation menu". Labels are sentence case and never punctuated. Where the region already starts with a visible heading, the label should match the heading text.

## Accessibility

Landmark regions let users bypass blocks and understand page structure (WCAG 1.3.1, 2.4.1). Each region has a role from the ARIA landmark set, and a name when the role appears more than once or when the role is `region` or `form`, which are landmarks only when named (4.1.2). Exactly one `main` per document. Native HTML elements are used wherever they imply the role, so no ARIA is added where the element already provides it, in line with the first rule of ARIA. Nested landmarks are allowed only where the APG allows them: a `navigation` inside `banner` is fine; a `main` inside anything is not.

## Platform notes

### Web
Choose the element from `role` unless `as` is set: `banner`→`<header role="banner">`, `navigation`→`<nav>`, `main`→`<main>`, `complementary`→`<aside>`, `contentinfo`→`<footer role="contentinfo">`, `region`→`<section aria-label>`, `search`→`<form role="search">`, `form`→`<form aria-label>`. Always emit `role` on `header` and `footer` and whenever `as` overrides the default element; never branch on `document` at render time (SSR). Apply `aria-label` from `label`. The forwarded ref is typed `HTMLElement` (not the specific element chosen by `as`), so render through `createElement` with `HTMLAttributes<HTMLElement>` rather than a union of intrinsic tags. Development warnings use `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'`.

### Lit
`<ds-landmark role="navigation" label="Main">` uses no shadow root. The property is `landmark` (attribute `role`). In `connectedCallback`, attach `ElementInternals`, set `internals.role` and `internals.ariaLabel`, and set `display: block` inline when unset, so the host element itself is the landmark and its light-DOM children are its content. Warnings are logged in development builds only (`import.meta.env.DEV`; the package tsconfig includes `vite/client` types).

### React Native
Render a `View` with the `role` prop (which react-native-web turns into the semantic element and iOS/Android map to the nearest accessibility role or ignore), and `accessibilityLabel={label}` for `navigation`, `region` and `form` so the group has a name for TalkBack and VoiceOver. Do not set `accessible={true}` on the container; it would collapse every child into one element. There is no jump-to-landmark on native — the value here is web parity and a consistent structure for the same screen code.
