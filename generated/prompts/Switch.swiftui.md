# Generate: Switch for SwiftUI (iOS)

You are generating a production component for the **Design Schema** design system. The component schema below is the source of truth. Do not invent props, events, or styles that are not in it, and do not omit any that are.

## Output

Write `packages/swiftui/Sources/DesignSchema/Switch.swift` declaring `public struct Switch: View` with a public initializer whose parameters are the schema's props **in the schema's order** (doc defaults as default arguments), then the event closures in the schema's order, then `overrides:`; nested `public enum`s for enum props (`String` raw values equal to the doc values, case names the values camel-cased — `icon-only` → `iconOnly` — with leading digits moved to the end, `2xl` → `xl2`, since nothing else is a Swift identifier); `public struct`s for `array`/`object` shapes named from the shape; closures for events named per `platforms.swiftui`; and `#Preview` blocks. That order and those names are a contract: `tools/behavior_tests.ts` writes `Tests/DesignSchemaTests/Generated/SwitchBehaviorTests.swift` from the doc's `behavior` block and calls this initializer directly. Beside it write `packages/swiftui/Sources/DesignSchema/Gallery+Switch.swift`: `public extension Gallery { static var <name>Screen: GalleryEntry { GalleryEntry("Switch") { … } } }`, one gallery screen showing the component in its states, where `<name>Screen` is the component name with a lower-case first letter. Never edit `Support/Gallery+Generated.swift` — the generator rewrites that list from the screen files.

## Rules

- Render the SwiftUI view declared under `platforms.swiftui.element` with the modifiers listed under `platforms.swiftui.props`. Map each event to its `platforms.swiftui` name.
- Read tokens from `@Environment(\.dsTheme)` (`DesignSchemaTokens`). Colors are `Color`, dimensions `CGFloat` points, durations `TimeInterval`, easings `Animation`, font weights `Font.Weight`, line heights unitless multipliers. Never hard-code a color, size, font or duration. A style binding like `color.action.{variant}.background` becomes a lookup keyed by the enum value.
- Implement every item in `a11y.requires` with SwiftUI's accessibility API:
  - `accessible-name`: `.accessibilityLabel(label)`; a visually hidden label is still the label.
  - `keyboard-operable` / `focus-visible`: `.focusable()` where the doc's keyboard table applies, `@FocusState` for the roving index, `.dsOnKeyPress` (the package's own wrapper around `.onKeyPress(keys:)`, so the behavior gate can reach the same handler) / `.onMoveCommand` / `.onExitCommand` for the keys, and the focus ring drawn from `focusRing`/`focusRingWidth` only for keyboard focus.
  - `target-24px` / `target-44px`: `.frame(minWidth: theme.sizeTargetMin, minHeight: …)` (or `sizeTargetComfortable`) plus `.contentShape(Rectangle())`.
  - `heading-hierarchy`: `.accessibilityAddTraits(.isHeader)`; `.accessibilityHeading(.h1…h6)` from the level prop.
  - `live-region`: `AccessibilityNotification.Announcement`.
  - `reduced-motion`: `@Environment(\.accessibilityReduceMotion)` disables every animation the doc names.
  - `selected-state` / `expanded-state`: `.isSelected` trait or `.accessibilityValue("expanded"/"collapsed")`.
  - `gesture-alternative`: every gesture has a visible control and an `.accessibilityAction`.
- `disabled` uses `opacity.disabled` on the whole element, `.accessibilityRespondsToUserInteraction(false)` and a press guard; never `.disabled(true)` unless the doc says the control leaves the focus order.
- Controlled/uncontrolled pairs (`value`/`defaultValue`, `open`/`defaultOpen`) become a `Binding<T>?` parameter plus a `default` initial value, with `@State` holding the uncontrolled value.
- `content` props are `@ViewBuilder` generic closures. Enum props whose values are quoted digits (Heading `level`, Stack `gap`) accept `Int` as well.
- Use every `copy.*` string verbatim through `String(localized:)`-ready constants; do not write your own user-facing text.
- Testability hooks: `.accessibilityIdentifier("Switch")` on the root and `"Switch.<part>"` on every anatomy part, names verbatim. The generated behavior tests find everything through them and assert against the accessibility tree, so a state the doc names has to be visible there: `expanded` as `.accessibilityValue("expanded")`/`("collapsed")`, `selected` as `.isSelected`, `disabled` as an element that reports itself not enabled.
- `keyboard` rules describe the web keyboard model; implement the subset an iPad hardware keyboard can reach and expose everything else through accessibility actions and visible controls. Overlays follow the conventions (sheet / fullScreenCover / popover / confirmationDialog / Menu).
- Props of type `array`, `object`, or `function` carry a `shape` string in TypeScript notation; translate it to a Swift `struct`/closure type with the same member names. `ReactNode` is a `@ViewBuilder` closure or `AnyView`.
- Interpolated style bindings (`color.status.{tone}.background`) resolve per enum value at render time; a resolved path ending in `.default` drops that segment; an enum value of `none` for a background/border/max-width binding renders nothing rather than a token.
- Composite components reuse the system's existing views (`Button`, `Link`, `Text`, `Heading`, `Icon`, `Stack`) from the package rather than re-implementing them, and never restyle a child: if a child needs a variation, the child's schema grows.
- Transitions use the component's own `transition` binding with `motion.easing.standard`; `motion.duration.fast` is only the default when a component has no `transition` binding.
- Development-only warnings use `#if DEBUG`.
- Previews are named after the prop and value in PascalCase (`ToneInfo`, `RoleBanner`).
- Icons: use `Icon(name:)` for every glyph the docs name; never draw a glyph inline and never use SF Symbols.
- Swift 6 strict concurrency: value-type views, `@MainActor` only around UIKit calls, no `@unchecked Sendable`.

## Overrides (per-instance styling contract)

The component accepts `overrides: [Binding: TokenRef] = [:]` where `Binding` is a nested `public enum Binding: String, CaseIterable` listing the overridable bindings below and `TokenRef` is the token-name enum generated into `DesignSchemaTokens`. Resolve each entry with `theme[ref]` and use the typed result in place of the binding's default token. This is the ONLY per-instance styling surface: there is no style modifier parameter, so a screen cannot drift from the system by passing points. Locked bindings are not cases of `Binding`.

Overrides change values, never presence: a prop that turns a part off (`surface: none`, `border: false`, `radius: none`) makes the matching overrides no-ops; apply an override only where the binding is in effect.

Overridable: `trackWidth`, `trackHeight`, `thumbSize`, `thumbInset`, `radius`, `gap`, `partGap`, `labelSize`, `labelWeight`, `helperSize`, `fontFamily`, `lineHeight`, `disabledOpacity`, `transition`
Locked (accessibility-bearing, never overridable): `trackOff`, `trackOn`, `thumb`, `labelColor`, `descriptionText`, `focusRing`, `focusRingWidth`, `minTarget`

## Platform notes (swiftui)

  \ the tokens (`trackOn`/`trackOff`/`thumb`) \u2014 not the system switch, which\
  \ cannot take the theme \u2014 with the thumb travel animated over the `transition`\
  \ binding unless reduced motion. VoiceOver reads it as a switch with on/off (`.accessibilityValue`),\
  \ the label from the label view; `hideLabel` uses `.labelsHidden()`. `checkedLabel`/`uncheckedLabel`\
  \ copy becomes the value text."
```

## Guidance

## Overview

A switch is a light switch: flip it and the thing happens. That immediacy is what separates it from a Checkbox, which records a choice to be submitted later. Every switch answers the question "is this on?" and the label names what "this" is.

## When to use

Use a Switch for a binary setting that applies as soon as it changes and can be undone by flipping it back: notifications, dark mode, Wi‑Fi, "show archived". Use it in settings lists and preference panels, with `labelPosition: start` so the labels line up and the switches sit at the row end.

## When not to use

Do not use a Switch for a choice that is only applied on Save or Submit; use Checkbox, so the user is not misled into thinking the change is already live. If a form of switches must have a Save button, the switches are checkboxes. Do not use a Switch for two named options ("Metric / Imperial"); that is a RadioGroup or a SegmentedControl (planned). Do not use a Switch where turning it on triggers a flow (a confirmation dialog, a sign-in): use a Button, because a switch that jumps back to off when the flow is cancelled is confusing.

## Behavior

Clicking or tapping the row, or pressing Space on the control, flips the state, moves the thumb, and fires `onChange` with the new boolean. Enter is neither intercepted nor used to toggle. The row is full width: with `labelPosition: start` the label is at the start and the switch at the row's end; with `end` the switch comes first and the label follows it. The consumer applies the effect immediately; if it can fail asynchronously, the switch should be controlled and flipped back with an error message elsewhere — the switch itself has no error state by design. Uncontrolled unless `checked` is provided. `disabled` switches are visible, readable and focusable (`aria-disabled`), and do not toggle. Thumb travel is animated with `transition`, and is instant when the user prefers reduced motion. Inside a Fieldset the field reads `FieldsetContext`: `disabled` from the group applies as if set on the field, and on native the legend prefixes the accessibility label ("Shipping address, Street").

## Content guidelines

The label names the thing, not the state ("Email notifications", not "Turn on email notifications" or "Enabled"): the state is announced by the control and shown by its position. Do not add "On/Off" text next to the track; it is redundant for sighted users and read twice by screen readers. Descriptions state the effect in one sentence ("Sends a daily summary at 9:00").

## Accessibility

The switch has role `switch` and its state is exposed as `aria-checked` / `accessibilityState.checked`, so screen readers announce "on" or "off" (WCAG 4.1.2). The label is visible and associated (1.3.1, 3.3.2). State is not conveyed by color alone: the thumb position changes (1.4.1). The on track meets 3:1 against the page background and the thumb meets 3:1 against both track states (1.4.11); the build checks these as non-text pairs. Focus is visible around the track (2.4.7). Space toggles the switch (2.1.1); Enter is left alone. The row meets the 44px comfortable target (2.5.8). The thumb animation respects `prefers-reduced-motion` (2.3.3).

## Platform notes

### Web
Render `<input type="checkbox" role="switch">` with `appearance: none`, sized `trackWidth × trackHeight`, and draw the thumb with a pseudo-element translated by `trackWidth − thumbSize − 2 × thumbInset` when checked. Set `aria-checked` explicitly to mirror the checked state (track it in component state when uncontrolled), since some screen readers do not derive it from a checkbox carrying `role="switch"`. For disabled, `aria-disabled` plus `preventDefault()` on `click` and `change`. Mirror the thumb travel under `[dir=rtl]`. Label with `<label for>`; the `labelPosition` prop changes flex order only.

### Lit
`<ds-switch>` is form-associated so a `name` inside a native `<form>` or `<ds-form>` contributes `"on"` when checked. The inner input is in the shadow root with `delegatesFocus: true`; re-dispatch a composed `change` CustomEvent with `detail: { checked }`. Reflect `checked` (initial), `disabled` and `label-position`.

### React Native
Use the native `Switch` with `accessibilityRole="switch"`, `accessibilityLabel`, `accessibilityHint={description}`, `accessibilityState={{ checked, disabled }}`, `trackColor={{ false: trackOff, true: trackOn }}`, `thumbColor={thumb}` and `ios_backgroundColor={trackOff}`. Wrap the row in a `Pressable` that toggles the value so the label is part of the target, with `accessible={false}` on the wrapper so the Switch is the single focusable element. The track and thumb dimensions come from the OS; the size tokens are documented but not applied here.
