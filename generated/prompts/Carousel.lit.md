# Generate: Carousel as a Lit web component

You are generating a production component for the **Design Schema** design system. The component schema below is the source of truth. Do not invent props, events, or styles that are not in it, and do not omit any that are.

## Output

Write `packages/lit/src/Carousel.ts` defining the custom element tag declared under `platforms.lit.tag` (a `LitElement` subclass), exporting the class and registering it with `customElements.define`. Add a `Carousel.stories.ts` covering every enum value of every enum prop.

## Rules

- Lit 3.3 with standard (TC39) decorators: each schema prop becomes a `@property()` auto-accessor — `@property({ type: String, reflect: true }) accessor variant: CarouselVariant = 'primary'` — never a plain decorated field (`experimentalDecorators` is off). Props listed under `platforms.lit.reflect` use `reflect: true` so they can be styled from outside with attribute selectors. Boolean props are boolean attributes (`type: Boolean`). Internal state is `@state() private accessor open = false`.
- Each event is dispatched as a `CustomEvent` named by its `platforms.lit` value with `bubbles: true, composed: true` so it crosses the shadow boundary.
- Styles live in `static override styles: CSSResult = css\`…\`` and read ONLY token custom properties (`var(--color-…)`), which inherit through the shadow root. Never hard-code a color, size, or font. A style binding like `color.action.{variant}.background` becomes an attribute selector per enum value, e.g. `:host([variant="primary"]) { background: var(--color-action-primary-background); }`.
- Implement every item in `a11y.requires` inside the shadow DOM using a native element (e.g. a real `<button>`), and use `delegatesFocus: true` in `static override shadowRootOptions: ShadowRootInit` so focusing the host focuses the inner element.
- `accessible-name`: forward `label` to visible text or `aria-label` on the inner element.
- `focus-visible`: style `:focus-visible` on the inner element with `--color-border-focus` / `--border-width-focus`.
- `heading-hierarchy`: render the matching `<h1>`–`<h6>` inside the shadow root based on the level prop.
- Support light and dark by relying on token variables only.
- Form ownership is DOM-tree based: slotted light-DOM children are not owned by a `<form>` inside a shadow root. Follow the platform notes for how ds-form and ds-input cooperate by `name`.
- Events named like native events (`focus`, `blur`) are the native retargeted events — do not dispatch a CustomEvent with the same name.
- `disabled` uses `opacity.disabled`; transitions use `motion.duration.fast` + `motion.easing.standard`, removed under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Use every `copy.*` string verbatim; do not write your own user-facing text.
- Testability hooks for the gates: the host carries `data-ds="<Name>"`; a component with a `keyboard` block ships a story exported as `Keyboard` that renders it open/present with its trigger (if any) and at least three focusable children.
- `keyboard` rules are the keyboard model: implement every key → action exactly as listed and nothing else; `composition` parts must render the named system element. Overlays: a modal dialog uses a native `<dialog>` inside the shadow root opened with `showModal()` (native focus trap, `inert` background and top layer); non-modal popups use the Popover API (`popover="manual"`, `showPopover()`) when available and a `position: fixed` fallback, positioned from the trigger and flipped at the viewport edge; body scroll is locked while a modal is open; focus returns to the opener on close; stacking uses `z-index: var(--layer-<name>)` inside the top layer.
- Props of type `array`, `object`, or `function` carry a `shape` string in TypeScript notation; use it verbatim as the type. Prop type `content` is `ReactNode` / a slot / `ReactNode` by platform.
- Interpolated style bindings (`color.status.{tone}.background`) resolve per enum value at render time; never enumerate them by hand where a lookup will do. A resolved path ending in `.default` drops that segment (`color.background.{surface}` with `default` is `color.background`, i.e. `--color-background` / `colorBackground`); an enum value of `none` for a background/border/max-width binding renders nothing rather than a token.
- Composite components (Breadcrumb, Alert, RadioGroup) reuse the system's existing components (Link, Button, Text) from the same package rather than re-implementing them, and never restyle a child (no class overrides, no `::part`, no style props reaching into it): if a child needs a variation, the child's schema grows.
- Transitions use the component's own `transition` binding (its token and description), with `motion.easing.standard`; `motion.duration.fast` is only the default when a component has no `transition` binding.
- Development-only warnings the docs ask for use the platform convention: `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'` (React), `import.meta.env.DEV` (Lit), `__DEV__` (React Native).
- Stories are named after the prop and value in PascalCase (`ToneInfo`, `RoleBanner`); demo stories are titled `Demo/<Name>/<Platform>`.
- Icons: use the system `Icon` component for every glyph the docs name (`<Icon name="external" inline />`, `<ds-icon name="close">`, `<Icon name="check" color={…} />`); never draw an inline SVG or a Unicode glyph by hand. Decorative icons take no label; a glyph that carries meaning gets one.
- Stories: Storybook 10 CSF3 with `@storybook/web-components-vite` and `html` from lit; title `'<Name>/Lit'`; one story per enum value plus Default.
- TypeScript 7 with `isolatedDeclarations`: every exported symbol carries an explicit type annotation and no export type is inferred — `protected override render(): TemplateResult` (`TemplateResult | typeof nothing` when a branch renders nothing), typed static members, public methods with return types, `const meta: Meta = …` in stories. `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` (`name?: T | undefined`), `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and `verbatimModuleSyntax` (`import type`) are on.
- Tests run on Vitest 5 browser mode over Vite 8 (Playwright, Chromium; helpers from `vitest/browser`); the behavior scenarios below become `Carousel.test.ts`.

## Declared contracts

The sections between the schema and the overrides resolve what the schema declares for lit; a section is absent when the component declares none of it. Where one disagrees with prose or a rule above, the section wins.

- **Events**: dispatch each as a `CustomEvent` under its emitted name whose `detail` has exactly the listed keys, and type `reason` as the union of its reasons. A `cancelable` event is dispatched with `cancelable: true`, and the element skips the default action when `dispatchEvent` returns `false`. Fire only for the listed `fires` sources, in the `timing` order given.
- **Controlled state**: implement every pair: controlled when the property is set, uncontrolled from the default property otherwise (`@state`), the event fired in both modes; a controlled element shows the new state only once the property changes.
- **Parts and slots**: render each slot only as `<slot>` under its resolved name (the default slot unnamed). A composed part receives exactly the listed `props`, and each forward reaches the child's `overrides` under the child binding named; add no other.
- **Style bindings**: a binding styles its `part` (the `data-part` element in the shadow root), only in its `state` (`:hover`, `:focus-visible`, the reflected state attribute), with the token listed for each `by` value; write `computed` as the given `calc()`. Never introduce a literal: the literal gate still applies.
- **Keyboard**: implement the listed rules as written and none the section excludes; `target` is the part that opens or closes, `repeat` the presses, and a `native` rule needs no code. A rule with `given` needs the `Keyboard` story to accept those args from the story URL shown.
- **Form and overlay**: a field registers through the one form contract `discovery` names, submitting `value` as `valueType` under `name` and running `validation` in order with the `messages` copy. An overlay anchors to `anchor`, reads `placement`, handles overflow by `collision`, dismisses exactly by `dismiss` through `closeEvent`, and is modal only when `modal` is true; this replaces the overlay defaults above.
- **Copy**: interpolate only the listed `params` and props; select a plural form with `new Intl.PluralRules(locale).select(count)`; never concatenate a count into a sentence.
- **Constants and examples**: logic reads each constant through its token expression, never the number it resolves to today. Every example is a story with the name shown and exactly its `given` as args.
- **Lifecycle**: a deprecated property, event, value or element keeps working, carries a `@deprecated` JSDoc tag naming `use`, and warns once in development (`import.meta.env.DEV`) naming `use`.
- A `type: integer` prop accepts whole numbers only: type it `number` and never produce a fraction.

## Overrides (per-instance styling contract)

Every style binding above becomes a CSS custom-property hook on `:host`, named `--ds-<tag-without-prefix>-<binding>` (kebab-case), defaulting to its token: `:host {{ --ds-button-padding-inline: var(--space-md) }}` and rules read `var(--ds-button-padding-inline)`, never the token directly. Interpolated bindings set the hook per reflected attribute (`:host([variant="primary"]) {{ --ds-button-background: var(--color-action-primary-background) }}`). Because document styles on the host beat `:host` rules, consumers can override from CSS (`ds-button.hero {{ --ds-button-padding-inline: var(--space-lg) }}`) — that is the sanctioned escape hatch.

The element also has an `overrides` property (`attribute: false`, `Partial<Record<OverridableBinding, TokenRef>>`, `TokenRef` from `@design-schema/tokens`) that sets the hooks with `this.style.setProperty(hook, 'var(--<token-kebab>)')`. Locked bindings are not in the type and are ignored. No `::part` is exposed for styling.

Overrides change values, never presence: a prop that turns a part off (`surface: none`, `border: false`, `radius: none`) makes the matching overrides no-ops; apply an override only where the binding is in effect.

Overridable: `slideGap`, `controlOffset`, `controlShadow`, `pickerGap`, `pickerOffset`, `dotSize`, `radius`, `transition`
Locked (accessibility-bearing, never overridable): `controlBackground`, `dot`, `dotActive`, `dotTarget`, `minTarget`, `focusRing`, `focusRingWidth`

## Behavior scenarios (5)

Each scenario below becomes one test. They are platform-neutral: `given` are prop overrides on the `Default` story's args, `when` is one interaction, `then` is a list of expectations. Scenarios marked `derived` were produced by the parser from the schema; the rest were written in the doc. Render every scenario; never skip one because the component does not satisfy it. A scenario the code fails is a failing test, and a scenario that cannot be expressed on this platform is a gap to report, not a test to delete.

## Guidance

## Overview

A carousel shows several things in the space of one and lets the user page through them. It earns its place only when every slide is worth seeing and the controls make it obvious there is more; an auto-rotating banner that nobody clicks is the failure mode this component is designed to avoid.

## When to use

Use a Carousel for a small set (three to eight) of peer items too rich to show as a grid — featured products with images, testimonials, a gallery — where paging is a reasonable way to see them all. Use `picker: tabs` when slides have meaningful names ("Plans", "Pricing"); `dots` for images. Leave `autoplay` off unless the content is ambient (a hero of photographs) and even then keep the pause control visible.

## When not to use

Do not use a Carousel to hide important content behind slide two; if users must see it, lay it out. Do not use it for a list that can grow past ten items (a scrolling row of Cards with no controls, or a grid) or for step-by-step content (Stepper). Do not autoplay anything with text people need to read.

## Behavior

Previous and Next move one slide (or one page of `perView`), disabled at the ends unless `loop`. The picker jumps directly. Swipe on touch and horizontal scroll on trackpads work through scroll-snap, and the active index follows what is visible. `autoplay` advances every `interval`, pauses on hover, focus or touch, and stops for good when the user presses pause; it never starts under reduced motion. `onChange` reports each change with its reason so analytics can distinguish user paging from rotation. Hidden slides are inert: their links and buttons are not in the tab order and not announced. Previous and Next move by one page — `perView` slides. Hover, focus and touch pause rotation only while they last; the pause button stops it until play is pressed. Without `loop`, autoplay stops at the last slide. `CarouselSlide` takes a `label` (its name in the picker and the announcement) on every platform. Picker items are Carousel's own buttons, not the Button component. Below `layout.maxWidth.prose` `perView` collapses to one. Under reduced motion the play/pause control is not rendered, since rotation can never start.

## Content guidelines

Slides are parallel: same shape, same heading level, same amount of text. Each slide has a heading so its name is meaningful in the picker and the announcement. Keep an obvious hint that there is more (the next slide peeking, the arrows, the dots) — a carousel that looks like a single image gets treated as one.

## Accessibility

The container is a `region` named for its content with `aria-roledescription="carousel"`, and each slide a `group` with `aria-roledescription="slide"` and a positional name (WCAG 1.3.1, 4.1.2; APG carousel). Controls come before the slides in tab order and include play/pause whenever rotation is possible (2.2.2). Rotation stops on hover and focus and under reduced motion (2.3.3), and changes made by the user are announced while automatic ones are not (4.1.3). Swiping has the arrow buttons and, on native, the adjustable actions as alternatives (2.5.1). The picker conveys the current slide by state, not color alone, and dots have 24px targets despite their size.

## Platform notes

### Web
Render `<section role="region" aria-roledescription="carousel" aria-label data-ds="Carousel">` with, in order: the play/pause `Button` (when `autoplay`), the previous and next `Button`s (`secondary`, `iconOnly`, chevron Icons, on `controlBackground` when overlaid), the viewport `<div>` (`overflow-x: auto; scroll-snap-type: x mandatory; scrollbar-width: none`) containing the track and `CarouselSlide`s (`role="group" aria-roledescription="slide" aria-label`, `scroll-snap-align: start`, `inert` when not visible), and the picker (`dots`: `<div role="group">` of `Button ghost iconOnly` with `aria-current`; `tabs`: `role="tablist"` of `role="tab"` buttons with `aria-selected` and `aria-controls` to the slides, arrow keys per Tabs). An `IntersectionObserver` at threshold 0.6 sets the active index. `scrollIntoView({ behavior: reducedMotion ? 'instant' : 'smooth', inline: 'start' })` for programmatic moves. A visually-hidden `aria-live="polite"` region receives `copy.announce` on user-initiated changes.

### Lit
`<ds-carousel label="Featured" picker="tabs"><ds-carousel-slide heading="…">…</ds-carousel-slide></ds-carousel>`; scroll-snap viewport with the slot inside; IntersectionObserver on assigned elements; composed `change`.

### React Native
`FlatList` horizontal with `pagingEnabled`/`snapToInterval`, `showsHorizontalScrollIndicator={false}`, `onViewableItemsChanged` with `viewabilityConfig { itemVisiblePercentThreshold: 60 }`; slides as `View accessible accessibilityLabel={copy.slideLabel + heading}`; the arrows and picker as system `Button`s; region `View accessibilityRole="adjustable"` with increment/decrement `accessibilityActions`. Autoplay: `setInterval` guarded by `useReducedMotion()`, cleared in `onTouchStart`.
