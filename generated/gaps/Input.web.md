# Gaps reported while generating Input for web

Each entry is a place the doc made the generator guess. Fix the doc, re-run parse, regenerate.

- Input: the schema's Overrides section makes labelWeight/helperSize/lineHeight/fontFamily/descriptionText/errorText bindings that Input itself owns, but the general composition rule says to render label/description/error via the shared Text component, which doesn't expose per-instance CSS hooks for those bindings. Rendered label/description/error as plain elements styled by Input's own --ds-input-* custom properties instead (matching Button's own precedent of a plain <span> for its label, not Text), so the override contract actually works.
- Input: focusRingWidth's description ('replaces borderWidth when focused; padding shrinks by the difference') conflicts with the general :focus-visible outline convention used by other components. Implemented it literally as written for this component: border thickens/recolors on focus with compensating padding via calc(), no separate outline layer.
- Input: a11y.role is declared as a single 'textbox' for all `type` values, but native ARIA mapping differs per type (search -> searchbox, number -> spinbutton, password -> no role). Left `type` to drive real browser semantics rather than forcing role='textbox' everywhere, since overriding the native role would fight the platform.
- Input: disabled styling only lists a `disabledOpacity` binding (no separate disabled background/foreground tokens), so disabled dims the field via opacity alone rather than swapping to a muted background/foreground as the file previously did.
- Input: added a companion Input.test.tsx (one test per behavior scenario, Button.test.tsx-style) since the Behavior scenarios section asked for scenario-derived tests even though the Output section only named Input.tsx and Input.stories.tsx.
