# Generate: SegmentedControl for SwiftUI (iOS)

You are generating a production component for the **Design Schema** design system. The component schema below is the source of truth. Do not invent props, events, or styles that are not in it, and do not omit any that are.

## Output

Write `packages/swiftui/Sources/DesignSchema/SegmentedControl.swift` declaring `public struct SegmentedControl: View` with a public initializer whose parameters are the schema's props **in the schema's order** (doc defaults as default arguments), then the event closures in the schema's order, then `overrides:`; nested `public enum`s for enum props (`String` raw values equal to the doc values, case names the values camel-cased — `icon-only` → `iconOnly` — with leading digits moved to the end, `2xl` → `xl2`, since nothing else is a Swift identifier); `public struct`s for `array`/`object` shapes named from the shape; closures for events named per `platforms.swiftui`; and `#Preview` blocks. That order and those names are a contract: `tools/behavior_tests.ts` writes `Tests/DesignSchemaTests/Generated/SegmentedControlBehaviorTests.swift` from the doc's `behavior` block and calls this initializer directly. Beside it write `packages/swiftui/Sources/DesignSchema/Gallery+SegmentedControl.swift`: `public extension Gallery { static var <name>Screen: GalleryEntry { GalleryEntry("SegmentedControl") { … } } }`, one gallery screen showing the component in its states, where `<name>Screen` is the component name with a lower-case first letter. Never edit `Support/Gallery+Generated.swift` — the generator rewrites that list from the screen files.

## Rules

- Render the SwiftUI view declared under `platforms.swiftui.element` with the modifiers listed under `platforms.swiftui.props`. Map each event to its `platforms.swiftui` name.
- Read tokens from `@Environment(\.dsTheme)` (`DesignSchemaTokens`). Colors are `Color`, dimensions `CGFloat` points, durations `TimeInterval`, easings `Animation`, font weights `Font.Weight`, line heights unitless multipliers. Never hard-code a color, size, font or duration. A style binding like `color.action.{variant}.background` becomes a lookup keyed by the enum value.
- Implement every item in `a11y.requires` with SwiftUI's accessibility API:
  - `accessible-name`: `.accessibilityLabel(label)`; a visually hidden label is still the label.
  - `keyboard-operable` / `focus-visible`: `.focusable()` where the doc's keyboard table applies, `@FocusState` for the roving index, `.dsOnKeyPress` (the package's own wrapper around `.onKeyPress(keys:)`, so the behavior gate can reach the same handler) / `.onMoveCommand` / `.onExitCommand` for the keys, and the focus ring drawn from `focusRing`/`focusRingWidth` only for keyboard focus.
  - `target-24px` / `target-44px`: `.frame(minWidth: theme.sizeTargetMin, minHeight: …)` (or `sizeTargetComfortable`) plus `.contentShape(Rectangle())`.
  - `heading-hierarchy`: `.accessibilityAddTraits(.isHeader)`; `.accessibilityHeading(.h1…h6)` from the level prop.
  - `live-region`: `AccessibilityNotification.Announcement`.
  - `reduced-motion`: `@Environment(\.accessibilityReduceMotion)` disables every animation the doc names.
  - `selected-state` / `expanded-state`: `.isSelected` trait or `.accessibilityValue("expanded"/"collapsed")`.
  - `gesture-alternative`: every gesture has a visible control and an `.accessibilityAction`.
- `disabled` uses `opacity.disabled` on the whole element, `.accessibilityRespondsToUserInteraction(false)` and a press guard; never `.disabled(true)` unless the doc says the control leaves the focus order.
- Controlled/uncontrolled pairs (`value`/`defaultValue`, `open`/`defaultOpen`) become a `Binding<T>?` parameter plus a `default` initial value, with `@State` holding the uncontrolled value.
- `content` props are `@ViewBuilder` generic closures. Enum props whose values are quoted digits (Heading `level`, Stack `gap`) accept `Int` as well.
- Use every `copy.*` string verbatim through `String(localized:)`-ready constants; do not write your own user-facing text.
- Testability hooks: `.accessibilityIdentifier("SegmentedControl")` on the root and `"SegmentedControl.<part>"` on every anatomy part, names verbatim. The generated behavior tests find everything through them and assert against the accessibility tree, so a state the doc names has to be visible there: `expanded` as `.accessibilityValue("expanded")`/`("collapsed")`, `selected` as `.isSelected`, `disabled` as an element that reports itself not enabled.
- `keyboard` rules describe the web keyboard model; implement the subset an iPad hardware keyboard can reach and expose everything else through accessibility actions and visible controls. Overlays follow the conventions (sheet / fullScreenCover / popover / confirmationDialog / Menu).
- Props of type `array`, `object`, or `function` carry a `shape` string in TypeScript notation; translate it to a Swift `struct`/closure type with the same member names. `ReactNode` is a `@ViewBuilder` closure or `AnyView`.
- Interpolated style bindings (`color.status.{tone}.background`) resolve per enum value at render time; a resolved path ending in `.default` drops that segment; an enum value of `none` for a background/border/max-width binding renders nothing rather than a token.
- Composite components reuse the system's existing views (`Button`, `Link`, `Text`, `Heading`, `Icon`, `Stack`) from the package rather than re-implementing them, and never restyle a child: if a child needs a variation, the child's schema grows.
- Transitions use the component's own `transition` binding with `motion.easing.standard`; `motion.duration.fast` is only the default when a component has no `transition` binding.
- Development-only warnings use `#if DEBUG`.
- Previews are named after the prop and value in PascalCase (`ToneInfo`, `RoleBanner`).
- Icons: use `Icon(name:)` for every glyph the docs name; never draw a glyph inline and never use SF Symbols.
- Swift 6 strict concurrency: value-type views, `@MainActor` only around UIKit calls, no `@unchecked Sendable`.

        with the tokens rather than used, so the theme applies.

      - '@FocusState'
      - matchedGeometryEffect
      notes: Not `Picker(.segmented)` (untinted, unthemeable). An `HStack` of equal-width
        `Button`s in a `.contain` element named by `label`, the selected one `.isSelected`
        with the selected surface drawn through `matchedGeometryEffect` sliding over
        `transition` (no slide under reduced motion). Arrows on iPad move selection
        immediately (radio semantics), matching the keyboard table. `iconOnly` segments
        carry their label as the accessibility label.
```

## Overrides (per-instance styling contract)

The component accepts `overrides: [Binding: TokenRef] = [:]` where `Binding` is a nested `public enum Binding: String, CaseIterable` listing the overridable bindings below and `TokenRef` is the token-name enum generated into `DesignSchemaTokens`. Resolve each entry with `theme[ref]` and use the typed result in place of the binding's default token. This is the ONLY per-instance styling surface: there is no style modifier parameter, so a screen cannot drift from the system by passing points. Locked bindings are not cases of `Binding`.

Overrides change values, never presence: a prop that turns a part off (`surface: none`, `border: false`, `radius: none`) makes the matching overrides no-ops; apply an override only where the binding is in effect.

Overridable: `groupPadding`, `groupRadius`, `segmentShadow`, `segmentRadius`, `segmentPaddingInline`, `segmentPaddingBlock`, `segmentGap`, `segmentSpacing`, `selectedWeight`, `paddingBlockSm`, `fontFamily`, `fontSize`, `fontWeight`, `lineHeight`, `transition`, `disabledOpacity`
Locked (accessibility-bearing, never overridable): `groupBackground`, `segmentColor`, `segmentSelectedColor`, `segmentSelectedBackground`, `minTarget`, `focusRing`, `focusRingWidth`

## Platform notes (swiftui)

```yaml
element: HStack
props:
- .accessibilityElement=contain
- Button
- .accessibilityAddTraits=isSelected
- .focusable
- .onMoveCommand
- '@FocusState'
- matchedGeometryEffect
notes: Not `Picker(.segmented)` (untinted, unthemeable). An `HStack` of equal-width
  `Button`s in a `.contain` element named by `label`, the selected one `.isSelected`
  with the selected surface drawn through `matchedGeometryEffect` sliding over `transition`
  (no slide under reduced motion). Arrows on iPad move selection immediately (radio
  semantics), matching the keyboard table. `iconOnly` segments carry their label as
  the accessibility label.
```

## Guidance

## Overview

A segmented control switches a mode: list or grid, day or week, metric or imperial. Exactly one segment is always selected, choosing takes effect at once, and there is nothing to submit — which is what separates it from a RadioGroup in a form, whose semantics it borrows.

## When to use

Use it for two to five short, parallel options that change what a region shows or how a tool behaves, where the user switches often and sees the effect immediately. Use `iconOnly` in toolbars where the icons are unambiguous (list/grid) and add Tooltips. Pair it with a visible Text label when the group's purpose is not obvious.

## When not to use

Do not use it to pick a value that is submitted later (RadioGroup) or that has consequences worth a confirmation. Do not use it for more than five options or long labels; use Tabs when the options are views of content, or Select. Do not use it as tabs: a segmented control does not own panels. Do not leave it with no selection.

## Behavior

Click or tap selects a segment and fires `onChange`. Keyboard: the group is one tab stop on the selected segment; arrows move focus *and* selection (radio semantics), wrapping and skipping disabled segments; Home and End jump. The pill slides to the selected segment. `fill` divides the width equally. Icon-only segments are wrapped in a Tooltip showing the label on every platform that has hover or focus (web, Lit); on native the label is the accessibility label. The control is horizontal only.

## Content guidelines

Labels are single words or short pairs in sentence case ("List", "Grid", "This week"). Do not use "On/Off" — that is a Switch. With `iconOnly`, the label is what a screen reader says and what the Tooltip shows, so it names the mode ("Grid view"), not the icon.

## Accessibility

Role `radiogroup` with a name and `radio` segments with `aria-checked` (WCAG 4.1.2; APG radio group), so assistive technology reports "3 of 3, selected". One tab stop with arrow movement. Selection is shown by the raised pill, the stronger and heavier text, and the checked state — not color alone (1.4.1). Icon-only segments carry their label as the accessible name and expose it visually through a Tooltip (1.1.1). The pill itself is deliberately low-contrast against the group (a page-colored surface with a soft shadow); WCAG 1.4.11 does not require it because the selected state is identified by the text change and the checked state, which is why the text pair on the pill is the one the build checks. Reduced motion stops the pill animation.

## Platform notes

### Web
`<div role="radiogroup" aria-label>` containing `<button type="button" role="radio" aria-checked tabindex>` per option with `<Icon>` and label; an absolutely positioned pill `<span aria-hidden>` sized and translated from the selected segment's offset with `transition`. Keydown on the group implements the keyboard table. `iconOnly` wraps each segment in `Tooltip` with `describes: false`.

### Lit
`<ds-segmented-control label="View mode" .options=${…} value="grid">`; roving tabindex in the shadow root; composed `change`.

### React Native
`View` with `accessibilityRole="radiogroup"` and `accessibilityLabel`, `flexDirection: 'row'`, background and padding from tokens; `Pressable accessibilityRole="radio" accessibilityState={{ checked }}` per option; pill as an `Animated.View` positioned from `onLayout` measurements. `iconOnly` sets `accessibilityLabel` to the option label.
