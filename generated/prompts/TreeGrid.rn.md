# Generate: TreeGrid for React Native

You are generating a production component for the **Design Schema** design system. The component schema below is the source of truth. Do not invent props, events, or styles that are not in it, and do not omit any that are.

## Output

Write `packages/rn/src/TreeGrid.tsx` exporting a typed React Native function component named `TreeGrid`.

## Rules

- React Native 0.87 with its strict TypeScript API (the default): import instance types for refs (`ViewInstance`, `TextInputInstance`, `ScrollViewInstance`, `HostInstance`), whole event types (`TextInputFocusEvent`, `LayoutChangeEvent`), and treat `ViewStyle`/`TextStyle` as read-only.
- React 19: `ref` is a prop; no forwardRef; `useId`. A component that exposes its root declares `ref?: Ref<ViewInstance> | undefined` (the root's instance type) in `TreeGridProps` and attaches it to the root; never `React.forwardRef`, `useActionState` or `useFormStatus`.
- Render the component declared under `platforms.rn.element` with the props listed under `platforms.rn.props`. Map each event to its `platforms.rn` name.
- Import tokens from `@design-schema/tokens/<theme-id>/rn/light` and `/dark` (flat ESM modules with `.d.ts`; the theme id is in the theme skill) and read the active mode from the package's `useTheme()` hook (`ThemeProvider` with mode light | dark | system). Dimensions and durations are numbers; `fontWeight` tokens are numbers and must be converted to RN's string union; `font.lineHeight.*` are unitless multipliers — multiply by the font size; `fontFamilyBody` is `"System"`. Never hard-code a color, size, or font. A style binding like `color.action.{variant}.background` becomes `tokens[\`colorAction${capitalize(variant)}Background\`]`.
- Implement every item in `a11y.requires` with React Native's accessibility API:
  - `accessible-name`: `accessibilityLabel={label}`.
  - `keyboard-operable` / `focus-visible`: rely on the native focus system; for `Pressable`, style the focused/pressed state via the `style` callback.
  - `target-24px` / `target-44px`: `minWidth`/`minHeight` from `tokens.sizeTargetMin` / `tokens.sizeTargetComfortable`, and `hitSlop` where the visual is smaller.
  - `heading-hierarchy`: RN has no heading levels — set `accessibilityRole="header"` and document that the `level` prop only controls typography.
- `disabled` sets `accessibilityState={{ disabled: true }}` in addition to `disabled`.
- There is no CSS cascade: every style must be explicit on the element.
- Enum props whose values are quoted digits (Heading `level`, Stack `gap`) accept both the string and the number.
- `disabled` uses `opacity.disabled` on the whole element; never invent a disabled color.
- Use every `copy.*` string verbatim; do not write your own user-facing text.
- Testability hooks: the root carries `testID="<Name>"` (react-native-web renders it as data-testid); a component with a `keyboard` block ships a story exported as `Keyboard` rendering it open with its trigger and at least three focusable children, for the axe gate and manual keyboard checks on react-native-web.
- `keyboard` rules describe the web keyboard model; on native implement the subset hardware keyboards can reach (Escape/back gesture = dismiss, Enter = activate) and expose everything else through accessibility actions and visible controls. Overlays: modal dialogs, sheets and action sheets use the native `Modal` (`accessibilityViewIsModal`, `onRequestClose` for the Android back button, `statusBarTranslucent`); the scrim is a `Pressable` with `color.overlay.scrim`; sheets animate from the bottom with `Animated` and support drag-to-dismiss ONLY as an addition to a visible close control (`gesture-alternative`); tooltips are not a native pattern — render the tooltip text as `accessibilityHint` and show it on long-press only; toasts use a portal-less `View` with `layer.toast` zIndex at the root.
- Props of type `array`, `object`, or `function` carry a `shape` string in TypeScript notation; use it verbatim as the type. Prop type `content` is `ReactNode` / a slot / `ReactNode` by platform.
- Interpolated style bindings (`color.status.{tone}.background`) resolve per enum value at render time; never enumerate them by hand where a lookup will do. A resolved path ending in `.default` drops that segment (`color.background.{surface}` with `default` is `color.background`, i.e. `--color-background` / `colorBackground`); an enum value of `none` for a background/border/max-width binding renders nothing rather than a token.
- Composite components (Breadcrumb, Alert, RadioGroup) reuse the system's existing components (Link, Button, Text) from the same package rather than re-implementing them, and never restyle a child (no class overrides, no `::part`, no style props reaching into it): if a child needs a variation, the child's schema grows.
- Transitions use the component's own `transition` binding (its token and description), with `motion.easing.standard`; `motion.duration.fast` is only the default when a component has no `transition` binding.
- Development-only warnings the docs ask for use the platform convention: `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'` (React), `import.meta.env.DEV` (Lit), `__DEV__` (React Native).
- Stories are named after the prop and value in PascalCase (`ToneInfo`, `RoleBanner`); demo stories are titled `Demo/<Name>/<Platform>`.
- Icons: use the system `Icon` component for every glyph the docs name (`<Icon name="external" inline />`, `<ds-icon name="close">`, `<Icon name="check" color={…} />`); never draw an inline SVG or a Unicode glyph by hand. Decorative icons take no label; a glyph that carries meaning gets one.
- Stories: Storybook 10 CSF3 with `@storybook/react-vite`, run under react-native-web; title `'<Name>/React Native'`; one story per enum value plus Default; wrap in `ThemeProvider`.
- TypeScript 7 with `isolatedDeclarations`: every exported symbol carries an explicit type annotation and no export type is inferred — the component returns `React.JSX.Element` (`| null` when it can render nothing), exported constants, contexts and hooks are annotated, `const meta: Meta<typeof TreeGrid> = …` in stories. `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` (`name?: T | undefined`), `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and `verbatimModuleSyntax` (`import type`) are on.
- Tests run on Jest 30 with `@react-native/jest-preset` and `@testing-library/react-native` 13 (synchronous `render`/`fireEvent`); the behavior scenarios below become `TreeGrid.test.tsx`.

## Overrides (per-instance styling contract)

The component accepts `overrides?: Partial<Record<OverridableBinding, TokenRef>>` where `OverridableBinding` is the union of the overridable bindings below and `TokenRef` is the token-name union exported by `@design-schema/tokens` (dotted names, e.g. `'space.lg'`). Resolve each entry through the theme with `resolveToken(t, ref)` — both `TokenRef` and `resolveToken` are imported from `@design-schema/tokens`, not from `./theme` (dotted → camelCase key), and use the result in place of the binding's default token. This is the ONLY per-instance styling surface: there is no `style` prop, so a screen cannot drift from the system by passing pixels. Locked bindings are not in the type and are ignored if passed.

Overrides change values, never presence: a prop that turns a part off (`surface: none`, `border: false`, `radius: none`) makes the matching overrides no-ops; apply an override only where the binding is in effect.

The `platforms.rn.props` list names the native props the schema cares about; `overrides` and `testID` apply to every component regardless of whether that list mentions them.

Overridable: `indent`, `expandGap`, `guideLine`, `guideLineWidth`, `parentWeight`, `transition`
Locked (accessibility-bearing, never overridable): `expandButtonSize`, `loadingColor`, `focusRing`, `focusRingWidth`, `minTarget`

## Behavior scenarios (10)

Each scenario below becomes one test. They are platform-neutral: `given` are prop overrides on the `Default` story's args, `when` is one interaction, `then` is a list of expectations. Scenarios marked `derived` were produced by the parser from the schema; the rest were written in the doc. Render every scenario; never skip one because the component does not satisfy it. A scenario the code fails is a failing test, and a scenario that cannot be expressed on this platform is a gap to report, not a test to delete.

  target (minimum size) since there are no arrow keys.

## Guidance

## Overview

A tree grid is a data grid where rows have rows inside them. The hierarchy lives in the row-header column — indent, a chevron, a level announced to screen readers — and everything else is DataGrid: same columns, same cell navigation, same editors. Collapsing a parent removes its descendants from the visible list, which is also the virtualized list, so a hundred thousand leaf rows cost nothing until they are opened.

## When to use

Use a TreeGrid when records nest and each record has several comparable fields: a chart of accounts with balances, folders and files with sizes and dates, a bill of materials with quantities and costs, an org chart with headcount. Use `children: "lazy"` for deep or large trees so the first paint is fast. Use `selectChildren` when selection means "this and everything in it" (a folder to export).

## When not to use

Do not use a TreeGrid for a hierarchy with one field per node — a navigation tree, a file picker with names only — that is a Tree. Do not use it for flat data (DataGrid) or for content people read row by row (Table). Do not nest more than about six levels; past that, give the user a way to open a subtree as its own root (a Breadcrumb above the grid).

## Behavior

Rows with children show a chevron in the row header; ArrowRight expands, ArrowLeft collapses or moves to the parent, `*` expands all siblings, Enter on the row header toggles. Expanded ids are controlled or uncontrolled; `onExpandChange` reports them. Lazy rows show a loading placeholder child until the caller supplies `children`. Sorting orders siblings within each parent and keeps the tree. Row selection with `selectChildren` cascades down and shows indeterminate parents. Vertical navigation moves through visible rows only; everything else — editing, cell selection, status bar, virtualization, pinned and resizable columns, sticky header, controlled and uncontrolled sort and selection — behaves as DataGrid, and the copy strings for those behaviors are TreeGrid's own (listed above, identical to DataGrid's) so each platform package is self-contained. Descendant, parent and sibling lookups are O(n) walks of `data`; only the visible-row list is optimized. `copy.level` and `copy.childCount` are used only in the native accessibilityLabel (web relies on aria-level/aria-setsize/aria-posinset); `copy.expandAll`/`copy.collapseAll` name the native root's expandAll/collapseAll accessibility actions and have no web control (`*` is the keyboard path).

## Content guidelines

The row header is the node's name; keep it short because it is indented. Show aggregate values on parent rows (a folder's total size, an account's balance) so a collapsed tree still reads. Order children meaningfully by default (by name, by code) and let sorting change it.

## Accessibility

The container is a `treegrid` (APG treegrid) and every row exposes `aria-level`, `aria-setsize` and `aria-posinset`, with `aria-expanded` only on rows that have children, so a screen reader hears "Assets, level 1, 1 of 4, expanded" (WCAG 1.3.1, 4.1.2). Expansion is keyboard-operable through the row itself — ArrowLeft/Right, Enter — with the chevron as a pointer convenience (2.1.1). The visible-row list is what `aria-rowindex` counts, so positions stay honest after collapsing. Focus stays on the row header when a subtree collapses under it (2.4.3). Guide lines are decorative (not checked for contrast) and indent is reinforced by the announced level, never the only signal (1.3.1). Everything else inherits DataGrid's guarantees.

## Platform notes

### Web
Build on DataGrid's implementation (a shared hook or base, not a copy): flatten `data` by `expanded` into visible rows carrying `level`, `posinset`, `setsize`, `hasChildren`, `parentId`; render the row header cell with `padding-inline-start: calc(var(--ds-tree-grid-indent) * (level - 1))`, the expand `Button` (`aria-hidden`, `tabIndex={-1}`) when `hasChildren`, and the guide line as a `::before` on child rows. Add `role="treegrid"` and the row attributes; extend DataGrid's keydown with the ArrowLeft/ArrowRight/`*` rules on the row-header column. Lazy: on expand of a `"lazy"` row, fire `onExpand`, mark the row `aria-busy`, and render a placeholder child until `children` changes.

### Lit
`<ds-tree-grid caption="Chart of accounts" .columns=${columns} .data=${tree} .expanded=${['assets']}></ds-tree-grid>`; extends the grid base class; composed `expand-change`, `expand`.

### React Native
DataGrid's `FlatList` over the flattened rows; the row header `Pressable` has `accessibilityState.expanded`, `accessibilityActions` expand/collapse, and the visible expand `Button` at minimum target size; indent by level.
