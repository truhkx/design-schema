# Generate: Stepper as a Lit web component

You are generating a production component for the **Design Schema** design system. The component schema below is the source of truth. Do not invent props, events, or styles that are not in it, and do not omit any that are.

## Output

Write `packages/lit/src/Stepper.ts` defining the custom element tag declared under `platforms.lit.tag` (a `LitElement` subclass), exporting the class and registering it with `customElements.define`. Add a `Stepper.stories.ts` covering every enum value of every enum prop.

## Rules

- Lit 3.3 with standard (TC39) decorators: each schema prop becomes a `@property()` auto-accessor — `@property({ type: String, reflect: true }) accessor variant: StepperVariant = 'primary'` — never a plain decorated field (`experimentalDecorators` is off). Props listed under `platforms.lit.reflect` use `reflect: true` so they can be styled from outside with attribute selectors. Boolean props are boolean attributes (`type: Boolean`). Internal state is `@state() private accessor open = false`.
- Each event is dispatched as a `CustomEvent` named by its `platforms.lit` value with `bubbles: true, composed: true` so it crosses the shadow boundary.
- Styles live in `static override styles: CSSResult = css\`…\`` and read ONLY token custom properties (`var(--color-…)`), which inherit through the shadow root. Never hard-code a color, size, or font. A style binding like `color.action.{variant}.background` becomes an attribute selector per enum value, e.g. `:host([variant="primary"]) { background: var(--color-action-primary-background); }`.
- Implement every item in `a11y.requires` inside the shadow DOM using a native element (e.g. a real `<button>`), and use `delegatesFocus: true` in `static override shadowRootOptions: ShadowRootInit` so focusing the host focuses the inner element.
- `accessible-name`: forward `label` to visible text or `aria-label` on the inner element.
- `focus-visible`: style `:focus-visible` on the inner element with `--color-border-focus` / `--border-width-focus`.
- `heading-hierarchy`: render the matching `<h1>`–`<h6>` inside the shadow root based on the level prop.
- Support light and dark by relying on token variables only.
- Form ownership is DOM-tree based: slotted light-DOM children are not owned by a `<form>` inside a shadow root. Follow the platform notes for how ds-form and ds-input cooperate by `name`.
- Events named like native events (`focus`, `blur`) are the native retargeted events — do not dispatch a CustomEvent with the same name.
- `disabled` uses `opacity.disabled`; transitions use `motion.duration.fast` + `motion.easing.standard`, removed under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Use every `copy.*` string verbatim; do not write your own user-facing text.
- Testability hooks for the gates: the host carries `data-ds="<Name>"`; a component with a `keyboard` block ships a story exported as `Keyboard` that renders it open/present with its trigger (if any) and at least three focusable children.
- `keyboard` rules are the keyboard model: implement every key → action exactly as listed and nothing else; `composition` parts must render the named system element. Overlays: a modal dialog uses a native `<dialog>` inside the shadow root opened with `showModal()` (native focus trap, `inert` background and top layer); non-modal popups use the Popover API (`popover="manual"`, `showPopover()`) when available and a `position: fixed` fallback, positioned from the trigger and flipped at the viewport edge; body scroll is locked while a modal is open; focus returns to the opener on close; stacking uses `z-index: var(--layer-<name>)` inside the top layer.
- Props of type `array`, `object`, or `function` carry a `shape` string in TypeScript notation; use it verbatim as the type. Prop type `content` is `ReactNode` / a slot / `ReactNode` by platform.
- Interpolated style bindings (`color.status.{tone}.background`) resolve per enum value at render time; never enumerate them by hand where a lookup will do. A resolved path ending in `.default` drops that segment (`color.background.{surface}` with `default` is `color.background`, i.e. `--color-background` / `colorBackground`); an enum value of `none` for a background/border/max-width binding renders nothing rather than a token.
- Composite components (Breadcrumb, Alert, RadioGroup) reuse the system's existing components (Link, Button, Text) from the same package rather than re-implementing them, and never restyle a child (no class overrides, no `::part`, no style props reaching into it): if a child needs a variation, the child's schema grows.
- Transitions use the component's own `transition` binding (its token and description), with `motion.easing.standard`; `motion.duration.fast` is only the default when a component has no `transition` binding.
- Development-only warnings the docs ask for use the platform convention: `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'` (React), `import.meta.env.DEV` (Lit), `__DEV__` (React Native).
- Stories are named after the prop and value in PascalCase (`ToneInfo`, `RoleBanner`); demo stories are titled `Demo/<Name>/<Platform>`.
- Icons: use the system `Icon` component for every glyph the docs name (`<Icon name="external" inline />`, `<ds-icon name="close">`, `<Icon name="check" color={…} />`); never draw an inline SVG or a Unicode glyph by hand. Decorative icons take no label; a glyph that carries meaning gets one.
- Stories: Storybook 10 CSF3 with `@storybook/web-components-vite` and `html` from lit; title `'<Name>/Lit'`; one story per enum value plus Default.
- TypeScript 7 with `isolatedDeclarations`: every exported symbol carries an explicit type annotation and no export type is inferred — `protected override render(): TemplateResult` (`TemplateResult | typeof nothing` when a branch renders nothing), typed static members, public methods with return types, `const meta: Meta = …` in stories. `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` (`name?: T | undefined`), `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and `verbatimModuleSyntax` (`import type`) are on.
- Tests run on Vitest 5 browser mode over Vite 8 (Playwright, Chromium; helpers from `vitest/browser`); the behavior scenarios below become `Stepper.test.ts`.

## Overrides (per-instance styling contract)

Every style binding above becomes a CSS custom-property hook on `:host`, named `--ds-<tag-without-prefix>-<binding>` (kebab-case), defaulting to its token: `:host {{ --ds-button-padding-inline: var(--space-md) }}` and rules read `var(--ds-button-padding-inline)`, never the token directly. Interpolated bindings set the hook per reflected attribute (`:host([variant="primary"]) {{ --ds-button-background: var(--color-action-primary-background) }}`). Because document styles on the host beat `:host` rules, consumers can override from CSS (`ds-button.hero {{ --ds-button-padding-inline: var(--space-lg) }}`) — that is the sanctioned escape hatch.

The element also has an `overrides` property (`attribute: false`, `Partial<Record<OverridableBinding, TokenRef>>`, `TokenRef` from `@design-schema/tokens`) that sets the hooks with `this.style.setProperty(hook, 'var(--<token-kebab>)')`. Locked bindings are not in the type and are ignored. No `::part` is exposed for styling.

Overrides change values, never presence: a prop that turns a part off (`surface: none`, `border: false`, `radius: none`) makes the matching overrides no-ops; apply an override only where the binding is in effect.

Overridable: `indicatorSize`, `indicatorBackground`, `indicatorFontSize`, `indicatorFontWeight`, `connector`, `labelWeight`, `labelCurrentWeight`, `labelSize`, `descriptionSize`, `stepHover`, `stepRadius`, `stepGap`, `partGap`, `fontFamily`, `transition`
Locked (accessibility-bearing, never overridable): `indicatorBorder`, `indicatorBorderWidth`, `indicatorCompleteBackground`, `indicatorCompleteForeground`, `indicatorCurrentBorder`, `indicatorErrorBackground`, `indicatorErrorForeground`, `indicatorErrorBorder`, `connectorComplete`, `connectorWidth`, `labelColor`, `labelUpcomingColor`, `descriptionColor`, `indicatorColor`, `minTarget`, `focusRing`, `focusRingWidth`

## Behavior scenarios (7)

Each scenario below becomes one test. They are platform-neutral: `given` are prop overrides on the `Default` story's args, `when` is one interaction, `then` is a list of expectations. Scenarios marked `derived` were produced by the parser from the schema; the rest were written in the doc. Render every scenario; never skip one because the component does not satisfy it. A scenario the code fails is a failing test, and a scenario that cannot be expressed on this platform is a gap to report, not a test to delete.

```yaml
- name: renders
  then:
  - renders: true
  derived: true
- name: renders-orientation-horizontal
  given:
    orientation: horizontal
  then:
  - renders: true
  derived: true

## Guidance

## Overview

A stepper is a map of a journey with a "you are here". It sets expectations (five steps, not fifteen), shows progress without a bar, and gives people a way back to a step they finished. It is navigation, not a form control; the number-stepping field is NumberInput.

## When to use

Use a Stepper for a flow with three to about seven ordered steps that each fit on a screen: checkout, account setup, a report builder, a multi-part application. Vertical with descriptions for flows that need explanation ("Verify your identity — takes about 2 minutes"); horizontal for short, familiar ones. Leave `navigable: completed` so people can correct earlier answers without losing later ones (the container keeps the later steps' state).

## When not to use

Do not use a Stepper for two steps (a Button that says "Continue" is enough) or for more than about eight (group them). Do not use it as Tabs — steps have an order and a current position, tabs do not. Do not use it to show task progress (ProgressBar) or to let users jump anywhere in a settings area (a `nav` of Links).

## Behavior

Steps before `current` render complete (check), the current one is marked, later ones are upcoming. A step can be marked `error` explicitly (validation failed on a step the user left). Navigable steps are Buttons that fire `onStepSelect`; the container decides whether to move. Non-navigable steps are inert text. Below the prose width a horizontal stepper shows only the current label and "Step n of m" (`compact`), keeping the row of indicators so the count is still visible. A navigable step is its own native `<button>` (Pressable on native) owned by Stepper — not the Button component, whose single-label API cannot hold an indicator, label and description — with the accessible name from `copy.stepLabel` plus the status word set as `aria-label`. Label and description colors are passed to the composed Text as `tone`/overrides. `navigable: completed` means every step before the current one, including one marked `error`. `compact` applies to horizontal steppers only.

## Content guidelines

Labels are two or three words in sentence case naming the step's content ("Shipping address", "Review order"), parallel across the list. Descriptions, when used, say what happens or how long it takes. Number the steps only through the indicator; never write "Step 1:" in the label — the component adds it for assistive technology.

## Accessibility

The stepper is a `nav` (named "Progress" or by the flow) containing an ordered list, and the current step carries `aria-current="step"` (WCAG 1.3.1, 4.1.2). Each step's name includes its number and status from copy, so a screen-reader user hears "Step 2: Payment, current step" (1.3.3). State is conveyed by the check/number/danger glyph and the status word, not by color alone (1.4.1), and the indicator ring meets 3:1 (1.4.11). Navigable steps are Buttons with visible focus and 24px targets; non-navigable ones are not focusable so Tab does not stop on decoration (2.4.3).

## Platform notes

### Web
Render `<nav aria-label={label ?? "Progress"} data-ds="Stepper"><ol>` with an `<li>` per step containing the indicator `<span aria-hidden>` (number, `Icon name="check"`, or `Icon name="danger"`), a connector `<span aria-hidden>` after all but the last, and the label/description `Text`s wrapped in a `Button variant="ghost"` when navigable (with `aria-current="step"` for the current step) or a `<div>` otherwise. A visually-hidden `<span>` inside the control adds the status word. `@container (max-width: <prose px>)` switches to compact for horizontal orientation (breakpoint read from the built token JSON, `literal-ok: breakpoint from layout.maxWidth.prose`).

### Lit
`<ds-stepper current="payment" .steps=${steps}></ds-stepper>`; shadow `<nav><ol>`; `step-select` composed; `container-type: inline-size` on the host for the compact switch.

### React Native
`View` (`accessibilityRole="list"`) laid out in a row or column; each step a `Pressable` (navigable) or `View` with `accessible`, `accessibilityLabel` from `copy.stepLabel` + status word, `accessibilityState.selected` for the current step. Connectors are `View`s with `connectorWidth`. Use `compact` on phones for horizontal steppers (decided by the screen width against `layout.maxWidth.prose`).
