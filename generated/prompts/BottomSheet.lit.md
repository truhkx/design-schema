# Generate: BottomSheet as a Lit web component

You are generating a production component for the **Design Schema** design system. The component schema below is the source of truth. Do not invent props, events, or styles that are not in it, and do not omit any that are.

## Output

Write `packages/lit/src/BottomSheet.ts` defining the custom element tag declared under `platforms.lit.tag` (a `LitElement` subclass), exporting the class and registering it with `customElements.define`. Add a `BottomSheet.stories.ts` covering every enum value of every enum prop.

## Rules

- Lit 3.3 with standard (TC39) decorators: each schema prop becomes a `@property()` auto-accessor — `@property({ type: String, reflect: true }) accessor variant: BottomSheetVariant = 'primary'` — never a plain decorated field (`experimentalDecorators` is off). Props listed under `platforms.lit.reflect` use `reflect: true` so they can be styled from outside with attribute selectors. Boolean props are boolean attributes (`type: Boolean`). Internal state is `@state() private accessor open = false`.
- Each event is dispatched as a `CustomEvent` named by its `platforms.lit` value with `bubbles: true, composed: true` so it crosses the shadow boundary.
- Styles live in `static override styles: CSSResult = css\`…\`` and read ONLY token custom properties (`var(--color-…)`), which inherit through the shadow root. Never hard-code a color, size, or font. A style binding like `color.action.{variant}.background` becomes an attribute selector per enum value, e.g. `:host([variant="primary"]) { background: var(--color-action-primary-background); }`.
- Implement every item in `a11y.requires` inside the shadow DOM using a native element (e.g. a real `<button>`), and use `delegatesFocus: true` in `static override shadowRootOptions: ShadowRootInit` so focusing the host focuses the inner element.
- `accessible-name`: forward `label` to visible text or `aria-label` on the inner element.
- `focus-visible`: style `:focus-visible` on the inner element with `--color-border-focus` / `--border-width-focus`.
- `heading-hierarchy`: render the matching `<h1>`–`<h6>` inside the shadow root based on the level prop.
- Support light and dark by relying on token variables only.
- Form ownership is DOM-tree based: slotted light-DOM children are not owned by a `<form>` inside a shadow root. Follow the platform notes for how ds-form and ds-input cooperate by `name`.
- Events named like native events (`focus`, `blur`) are the native retargeted events — do not dispatch a CustomEvent with the same name.
- `disabled` uses `opacity.disabled`; transitions use `motion.duration.fast` + `motion.easing.standard`, removed under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Use every `copy.*` string verbatim; do not write your own user-facing text.
- Testability hooks for the gates: the host carries `data-ds="<Name>"`; a component with a `keyboard` block ships a story exported as `Keyboard` that renders it open/present with its trigger (if any) and at least three focusable children.
- `keyboard` rules are the keyboard model: implement every key → action exactly as listed and nothing else; `composition` parts must render the named system element. Overlays: a modal dialog uses a native `<dialog>` inside the shadow root opened with `showModal()` (native focus trap, `inert` background and top layer); non-modal popups use the Popover API (`popover="manual"`, `showPopover()`) when available and a `position: fixed` fallback, positioned from the trigger and flipped at the viewport edge; body scroll is locked while a modal is open; focus returns to the opener on close; stacking uses `z-index: var(--layer-<name>)` inside the top layer.
- Props of type `array`, `object`, or `function` carry a `shape` string in TypeScript notation; use it verbatim as the type. Prop type `content` is `ReactNode` / a slot / `ReactNode` by platform.
- Interpolated style bindings (`color.status.{tone}.background`) resolve per enum value at render time; never enumerate them by hand where a lookup will do. A resolved path ending in `.default` drops that segment (`color.background.{surface}` with `default` is `color.background`, i.e. `--color-background` / `colorBackground`); an enum value of `none` for a background/border/max-width binding renders nothing rather than a token.
- Composite components (Breadcrumb, Alert, RadioGroup) reuse the system's existing components (Link, Button, Text) from the same package rather than re-implementing them, and never restyle a child (no class overrides, no `::part`, no style props reaching into it): if a child needs a variation, the child's schema grows.
- Transitions use the component's own `transition` binding (its token and description), with `motion.easing.standard`; `motion.duration.fast` is only the default when a component has no `transition` binding.
- Development-only warnings the docs ask for use the platform convention: `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'` (React), `import.meta.env.DEV` (Lit), `__DEV__` (React Native).
- Stories are named after the prop and value in PascalCase (`ToneInfo`, `RoleBanner`); demo stories are titled `Demo/<Name>/<Platform>`.
- Icons: use the system `Icon` component for every glyph the docs name (`<Icon name="external" inline />`, `<ds-icon name="close">`, `<Icon name="check" color={…} />`); never draw an inline SVG or a Unicode glyph by hand. Decorative icons take no label; a glyph that carries meaning gets one.
- Stories: Storybook 10 CSF3 with `@storybook/web-components-vite` and `html` from lit; title `'<Name>/Lit'`; one story per enum value plus Default.
- TypeScript 7 with `isolatedDeclarations`: every exported symbol carries an explicit type annotation and no export type is inferred — `protected override render(): TemplateResult` (`TemplateResult | typeof nothing` when a branch renders nothing), typed static members, public methods with return types, `const meta: Meta = …` in stories. `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` (`name?: T | undefined`), `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and `verbatimModuleSyntax` (`import type`) are on.
- Tests run on Vitest 5 browser mode over Vite 8 (Playwright, Chromium; helpers from `vitest/browser`); the behavior scenarios below become `BottomSheet.test.ts`.

## Declared contracts

The sections between the schema and the overrides resolve what the schema declares for lit; a section is absent when the component declares none of it. Where one disagrees with prose or a rule above, the section wins.

- **Events**: dispatch each as a `CustomEvent` under its emitted name whose `detail` has exactly the listed keys, and type `reason` as the union of its reasons. A `cancelable` event is dispatched with `cancelable: true`, and the element skips the default action when `dispatchEvent` returns `false`. Fire only for the listed `fires` sources, in the `timing` order given.
- **Controlled state**: implement every pair: controlled when the property is set, uncontrolled from the default property otherwise (`@state`), the event fired in both modes; a controlled element shows the new state only once the property changes.
- **Parts and slots**: render each slot only as `<slot>` under its resolved name (the default slot unnamed). A composed part receives exactly the listed `props`, and each forward reaches the child's `overrides` under the child binding named; add no other.
- **Style bindings**: a binding styles its `part` (the `data-part` element in the shadow root), only in its `state` (`:hover`, `:focus-visible`, the reflected state attribute), with the token listed for each `by` value; write `computed` as the given `calc()`. Never introduce a literal: the literal gate still applies.
- **Keyboard**: implement the listed rules as written and none the section excludes; `target` is the part that opens or closes, `repeat` the presses, and a `native` rule needs no code. A rule with `given` needs the `Keyboard` story to accept those args from the story URL shown.
- **Form and overlay**: a field registers through the one form contract `discovery` names, submitting `value` as `valueType` under `name` and running `validation` in order with the `messages` copy. An overlay anchors to `anchor`, reads `placement`, handles overflow by `collision`, dismisses exactly by `dismiss` through `closeEvent`, and is modal only when `modal` is true; this replaces the overlay defaults above.
- **Copy**: interpolate only the listed `params` and props; select a plural form with `new Intl.PluralRules(locale).select(count)`; never concatenate a count into a sentence.
- **Constants and examples**: logic reads each constant through its token expression, never the number it resolves to today. Every example is a story with the name shown and exactly its `given` as args.
- **Lifecycle**: a deprecated property, event, value or element keeps working, carries a `@deprecated` JSDoc tag naming `use`, and warns once in development (`import.meta.env.DEV`) naming `use`.
- A `type: integer` prop accepts whole numbers only: type it `number` and never produce a fraction.

```

## Overrides (per-instance styling contract)

Every style binding above becomes a CSS custom-property hook on `:host`, named `--ds-<tag-without-prefix>-<binding>` (kebab-case), defaulting to its token: `:host {{ --ds-button-padding-inline: var(--space-md) }}` and rules read `var(--ds-button-padding-inline)`, never the token directly. Interpolated bindings set the hook per reflected attribute (`:host([variant="primary"]) {{ --ds-button-background: var(--color-action-primary-background) }}`). Because document styles on the host beat `:host` rules, consumers can override from CSS (`ds-button.hero {{ --ds-button-padding-inline: var(--space-lg) }}`) — that is the sanctioned escape hatch.

The element also has an `overrides` property (`attribute: false`, `Partial<Record<OverridableBinding, TokenRef>>`, `TokenRef` from `@design-schema/tokens`) that sets the hooks with `this.style.setProperty(hook, 'var(--<token-kebab>)')`. Locked bindings are not in the type and are ignored. No `::part` is exposed for styling.

Overrides change values, never presence: a prop that turns a part off (`surface: none`, `border: false`, `radius: none`) makes the matching overrides no-ops; apply an override only where the binding is in effect.

Overridable: `scrim`, `shadow`, `radius`, `handleHeight`, `handleWidth`, `inset`, `partGap`, `footerGap`, `maxWidth`, `layer`, `enter`, `exit`
Locked (accessibility-bearing, never overridable): `surface`, `handle`, `focusRing`, `focusRingWidth`

## Behavior scenarios (5)

Each scenario below becomes one test. They are platform-neutral: `given` are prop overrides on the `Default` story's args, `when` is one interaction, `then` is a list of expectations. Scenarios marked `derived` were produced by the parser from the schema; the rest were written in the doc. Render every scenario; never skip one because the component does not satisfy it. A scenario the code fails is a failing test, and a scenario that cannot be expressed on this platform is a gap to report, not a test to delete.

```yaml
- name: renders
  then:
  - renders: true
  derived: true
- name: renders-height-content
  given:
    height: content
  then:
  - renders: true
  derived: true
- name: renders-height-half
  given:
    height: half
  then:
  - renders: true
  derived: true
- name: renders-height-full
  given:

  then:
  - renders: true

## Guidance

## Overview

A bottom sheet is the phone's dialog. It rises from the edge the thumb can reach, keeps the page visible behind a scrim so the user knows where they are, and goes away with a swipe, a tap outside, or a close button. On a wide screen the same content is a Dialog; the component decides which, so screens are written once.

## When to use

Use a BottomSheet on phones for a task or a set of choices that would otherwise be a Dialog: filters, a form of a few fields, details of a selected item, a picker with many options. Use `height: content` by default; `full` for a task that needs the whole screen but should still feel dismissable; `half` for a browsable list where seeing the page behind matters (a map with results). For a flat list of actions, ActionSheet is the lighter component.

## When not to use

Do not use a BottomSheet as a menu (ActionSheet or Menu), as a persistent panel (a bottom Landmark region), or for content the user must read at length (a page). Do not stack sheets. Do not rely on the drag gesture to teach dismissal; the close button is always visible.

## Behavior

Opening slides the sheet up and fades the scrim; focus moves to the first control or the title; the page behind is inert and its scroll locked. The body scrolls within the sheet; a downward drag on the header when the body is at its scroll top begins the dismiss gesture, and releasing past the threshold or with enough velocity fires `onDragDismiss` then `onClose('drag')` — otherwise the sheet springs back. Escape, the close button and a scrim tap request close as in Dialog. Above the `maxWidth` breakpoint the sheet presents as a centered Dialog of size md with the same props and events, so code does not branch on device. In the wide presentation the same props are forwarded to Dialog — `heading`, `hideHeading` (Dialog has it for this reason), `dismissible`, `footer` — and matching overrides (`inset`, `radius`, `partGap`, `footerGap`) are forwarded to Dialog''s `overrides`; sheet-only bindings (handle, edge radius, drag) are no-ops there. The always-present wrapper carries `data-ds="BottomSheet"` in both presentations. Crossing the breakpoint while open swaps presentation on the next render without an animated hand-off; focus and scroll lock are re-established by the new surface. Initial focus is FocusScope''s `first` (first control in the body, else the close button, else the heading); there is no `initialFocus` prop.

## Content guidelines

Titles name the task or the thing ("Filters", "Share to"). Footer actions follow Form's order. Sheets with a self-explanatory body (a share row of icons) may `hideHeading`, but the title text still exists for screen readers.

## Accessibility

Role `dialog`, `aria-modal`, named by the title even when visually hidden (WCAG 4.1.2). Focus trap, restore, Escape and inert background as in Dialog. The drag gesture is an addition: every sheet can be closed with a single pointer activation on the close button and with Escape (2.5.1 Pointer Gestures; gesture-alternative). The handle is decorative and skipped by keyboard and assistive technology. Touch targets in the sheet reach 44px (target-44px) because sheets are used one-handed. Motion respects reduced-motion; the drag-follow still tracks the finger, since it is user-driven, but the release animation is instant.

## Platform notes

### Web
Below the `maxWidth` breakpoint (a media query on the resolved token, `literal-ok`), render the native `<dialog>` with `position: fixed; inset-block-end: 0; inline-size: 100%; max-block-size: 90dvh` and top-only radius; `height` sets `block-size` for `half` (50dvh) and `full` (calc(100dvh - var(--layout-gutter))). Above it, render `<Dialog size="md">` with the same children. Pointer Events on the header: track `pointermove` deltaY, translate the surface, and on `pointerup` decide by distance (> 25% of sheet height) or velocity. Padding-bottom adds `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`.

### Lit
`<ds-bottom-sheet open heading="Filters" height="half">`; shadow `<dialog>`; `matchMedia` decides presentation and re-renders on change; drag handling as web. Composes `<ds-heading>`, `<ds-button>`, `<ds-icon>`, `<ds-box>`, `<ds-stack>`, and `<ds-dialog>` for the wide presentation.

### React Native
`Modal` with `transparent`; surface is an `Animated.View` anchored to the bottom with `translateY` driven by a `PanResponder` on the header; `height` sets the surface height as a fraction of `useWindowDimensions().height`; body in a `ScrollView` whose `scrollY` at 0 hands the gesture to the pan responder. Bottom padding includes the safe-area inset. On tablets wider than the `maxWidth` token, render `Dialog`. `onRequestClose` → `onClose('escape')`.
