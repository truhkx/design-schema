# Generate: Heading for React (web)

You are generating a production component for the **Design Schema** design system. The component schema below is the source of truth. Do not invent props, events, or styles that are not in it, and do not omit any that are.

## Output

Write `packages/react/src/Heading.tsx` exporting a typed React function component named `Heading`, plus `Heading.stories.tsx` covering every enum value of every enum prop.

## Rules

- React 19: `ref` is a prop; no forwardRef; `useId`; Actions are not used by components. Type the component as `function Heading({ ref, …rest }: HeadingProps & { ref?: Ref<HTMLElement> })` (the root element's type in place of `HTMLElement`) and attach `ref` to the root; generated ids come from `useId()`; never `useActionState`, `useFormStatus`, or a form `action` prop.
- Render the element and attributes declared under `platforms.web`. Map each event to its `platforms.web` name.
- Style ONLY through the CSS custom properties generated from tokens (`--color-…`, `--space-…`, `--font-…`, `--radius-…`). Never hard-code a color, size, or font. A style binding like `color.action.{variant}.background` becomes `var(--color-action-${variant}-background)`.
- Implement every item in `a11y.requires`:
  - `accessible-name`: the `label` prop is rendered as visible text or `aria-label`; never both empty.
  - `focus-visible`: a `:focus-visible` outline using `--color-border-focus` and `--border-width-focus`. Never remove the outline without replacing it.
  - `keyboard-operable`: native element semantics (do not build interactive elements from `<div>`).
  - `target-24px` / `target-44px`: `min-inline-size`/`min-block-size` from `--size-target-min` / `--size-target-comfortable`.
  - `heading-hierarchy`: render the heading level as the matching `<h1>`–`<h6>`; do not pick the element by visual size.
- `disabled` uses `aria-disabled="true"` and keeps the element focusable (WCAG-friendly) unless the schema says otherwise. On native checkable inputs (checkbox, radio, switch) `readOnly` has no effect, so guard with `preventDefault()` in both `click` and `change`.
- Visually hidden text (for accessible-name suffixes) uses the standard clip pattern — absolute, 1px box, `clip-path: inset(50%)`, `white-space: nowrap` — the one sanctioned use of pixel literals.
- Support light and dark by relying on the token variables only — no theme logic in the component.
- `disabled` uses `opacity.disabled`; transitions use `motion.duration.fast` + `motion.easing.standard` and are removed under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Use every `copy.*` string verbatim; do not write your own user-facing text.
- Testability hooks for the gates: the component root carries `data-ds="<Name>"`; a component with a `keyboard` block ships a story exported as `Keyboard` that renders it open/present with its trigger (if any) and at least three focusable children, no decorators that add other focusable elements.
- `keyboard` rules are the keyboard model: implement every key → action exactly as listed and nothing else; `composition` parts must render the named system component. Overlays: render into a portal at `document.body` (a `container` prop may override), lock body scroll while open, make the rest of the page `inert` for modal dialogs (`focus-trap` + `inert-background`), restore focus to the opener on close (`focus-restore`), position non-modal popups with `position: fixed` from the trigger's `getBoundingClientRect()` and flip when they would overflow the viewport, and put them on the right stacking layer with `z-index: var(--layer-<name>)`.
- Props of type `array`, `object`, or `function` carry a `shape` string in TypeScript notation; use it verbatim as the type. Prop type `content` is `ReactNode` / a slot / `ReactNode` by platform.
- Interpolated style bindings (`color.status.{tone}.background`) resolve per enum value at render time; never enumerate them by hand where a lookup will do. A resolved path ending in `.default` drops that segment (`color.background.{surface}` with `default` is `color.background`, i.e. `--color-background` / `colorBackground`); an enum value of `none` for a background/border/max-width binding renders nothing rather than a token.
- Composite components (Breadcrumb, Alert, RadioGroup) reuse the system's existing components (Link, Button, Text) from the same package rather than re-implementing them, and never restyle a child (no class overrides, no `::part`, no style props reaching into it): if a child needs a variation, the child's schema grows.
- Transitions use the component's own `transition` binding (its token and description), with `motion.easing.standard`; `motion.duration.fast` is only the default when a component has no `transition` binding.
- Development-only warnings the docs ask for use the platform convention: `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'` (React), `import.meta.env.DEV` (Lit), `__DEV__` (React Native).
- Stories are named after the prop and value in PascalCase (`ToneInfo`, `RoleBanner`); demo stories are titled `Demo/<Name>/<Platform>`.
- Icons: use the system `Icon` component for every glyph the docs name (`<Icon name="external" inline />`, `<ds-icon name="close">`, `<Icon name="check" color={…} />`); never draw an inline SVG or a Unicode glyph by hand. Decorative icons take no label; a glyph that carries meaning gets one.
- Enum props whose values are quoted digits (Heading `level`, Stack `gap`) accept both the string and the number.
- Stories: Storybook 10 CSF3 with `@storybook/react-vite`; title `'<Name>/React'`; one story per enum value plus Default.
- TypeScript 7 with `isolatedDeclarations`: every exported symbol carries an explicit type annotation and no export type is inferred — the component returns `ReactElement` (`ReactElement | null` when it can render nothing), exported constants, contexts and helpers are annotated, and `const meta: Meta<typeof Heading> = …` in stories. `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` (`name?: T | undefined`), `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and `verbatimModuleSyntax` (`import type`) are on.
- Tests run on Vitest 5 over Vite 8 (jsdom, `@testing-library/react`); the behavior scenarios below become `Heading.test.tsx`.
- Add a short JSDoc block that includes the "When to use" guidance verbatim.

## Component schema

```yaml

      - '6'
      required: true
      description: Position in the document outline. Controls the semantic element,
        not the visual size. Canonical values are strings; generated components also
        accept the number.
      a11y: Screen-reader users navigate by heading level; levels must not skip (h1
        → h3).
    size:

      values:
      - 4xl
      - 3xl

      description: 'Visual size, independent of level. Defaults per level: 1 → 4xl,
        2 → 3xl, 3 → 2xl, 4 → xl, 5 → lg, 6 → md.'
    children:
      type: content
      required: true
      description: The heading text. Keep it short and descriptive; it is what appears
        in the page outline.

    marginBlockEnd:
      token: space.sm
      description: Space below the heading (marginBottom on React Native — the one
        margin the system allows, because a heading owns the gap to its own first
        paragraph).
      locked: false
  a11y:
    role: heading
    requires:
    - heading-hierarchy
    - contrast-aaa
    contrast:
    - foreground: color.foreground.strong
      background: color.background
      level: AAA
  platforms:
    web:
      element: h1–h6
      attributes: []
      notes: The element is chosen by `level`. Never use `role="heading"` on a div
        when a real heading element is available.
    lit:
      tag: ds-heading
      reflect:
      - level
      - size
      - align
      notes: Renders the matching <h1>–<h6> inside the shadow root. Note that headings
        inside shadow roots are exposed to assistive technology normally, but some
        in-page outline tools do not see them.
    rn:
      element: Text
      props:
      - accessibilityRole=header
      notes: iOS and Android have no heading levels. `level` maps only to typography;
        the header trait is set regardless of level. Document the outline in the screen's
        design instead.
    swiftui:
      element: Text
      props:
      - .accessibilityAddTraits=isHeader
      - .accessibilityHeading
      - .font
      - .fontWeight
      notes: A `Text` with `.accessibilityAddTraits(.isHeader)` and `.accessibilityHeading(.h1…h6)`
        from `level` — VoiceOver's rotor lists headings by level, so the outline is
        real on iOS. Size from the `size` binding through `@ScaledMetric`; `level`
        never changes the look. `element` is ignored.
```

## Overrides (per-instance styling contract)

Every style binding above becomes a CSS custom-property hook on the component root, named `--ds-<component>-<binding>` (kebab-case), defaulting to its token: `.ds-button {{ --ds-button-padding-inline: var(--space-md); padding-inline: var(--ds-button-padding-inline); }}`. Interpolated bindings set the hook per modifier class (`.ds-button--primary {{ --ds-button-background: var(--color-action-primary-background) }}`). Rules always read the hook, never the token directly.

The component accepts `overrides?: Partial<Record<OverridableBinding, TokenRef>>` where `OverridableBinding` is the union of the overridable bindings below and `TokenRef` is the token-name union exported by `@design-schema/tokens` (`import type {{ TokenRef }} from '@design-schema/tokens'`). Each entry sets the hook inline as `var(--<token-kebab>)`. Locked bindings are not in the type and are ignored if passed. Consumers may also set the hooks from their own CSS; that is the sanctioned escape hatch and the docs say so.

Overrides change values, never presence: a prop that turns a part off (`surface: none`, `border: false`, `radius: none`) makes the matching overrides no-ops; apply an override only where the binding is in effect.

Overridable: `fontFamily`, `fontWeight`, `fontSize`, `lineHeight`, `marginBlockEnd`
Locked (accessibility-bearing, never overridable): `color`

## Behavior scenarios (16)

Each scenario below becomes one test. They are platform-neutral: `given` are prop overrides on the `Default` story's args, `when` is one interaction, `then` is a list of expectations. Scenarios marked `derived` were produced by the parser from the schema; the rest were written in the doc. Render every scenario; never skip one because the component does not satisfy it. A scenario the code fails is a failing test, and a scenario that cannot be expressed on this platform is a gap to report, not a test to delete.

```yaml
- name: renders
  then:
  - renders: true
  derived: true
- name: renders-level-1
  given:
    level: '1'
  then:
  - renders: true

## Platform notes (web)

element: "h1\u2013h6"
attributes: []
notes: The element is chosen by `level`. Never use `role="heading"` on a div when
  a real heading element is available.
```

## Guidance

## Overview

Headings label sections of content. Their most important job is invisible: they build the outline that screen-reader users jump through to understand and navigate a page.

## When to use

Use a Heading to title a page, a section, or a card that contains its own content. Choose `level` from the document outline — the page title is `1`, its major sections are `2`, their subsections `3` — and then choose `size` separately if the default visual size is wrong for the layout. Decoupling level from size is the whole point of this component: it lets designers pick the right look without breaking the outline.

## When not to use

Do not use a Heading purely to make text large or bold; use Text with a larger size. Do not skip levels (a `2` followed by a `4`) and do not use more than one `level: 1` per page or screen. Do not put interactive controls inside a heading.

## Content guidelines

Headings are short noun phrases in sentence case, unique within a page, and front-loaded with the most specific word. They should make sense when read in a list on their own, because that is exactly how screen-reader users encounter them.

## Accessibility

Headings must reflect the actual structure of the content (WCAG 1.3.1 Info and Relationships, 2.4.6 Headings and Labels, and 2.4.10 Section Headings at AAA). Levels must not skip. On web, the semantic element is always a real `<h1>`–`<h6>` chosen from `level`; visual size never influences the element. Heading text meets AAA contrast (7:1) against the page background in both themes because headings carry the most weight in a page's meaning. On native platforms there are no levels, so headings carry the platform header trait and the outline is documented in the screen design; this is a known, unavoidable gap between platforms and it is called out in the platform mapping table above.

## Platform notes

### Web
`level` selects the element. `size` maps to `font.size.*` via a class or inline custom property; the default size per level is 1→4xl, 2→3xl, 3→2xl, 4→xl, 5→lg, 6→md.

### Lit
`<ds-heading level="2">` renders `<h2>` inside its shadow root. `level`, `size` and `align` are reflected as attributes. Because the heading lives in a shadow root, styling comes through the `--ds-heading-*` hooks and `overrides`, never `::part`; `part="heading"` may remain on the inner element as an anatomy hook only.

### React Native
Renders `Text` with `accessibilityRole="header"`. `level` chooses the default size only. iOS VoiceOver exposes the header trait but not a level; Android TalkBack likewise. Do not simulate levels with `accessibilityLabel` prefixes like "Heading level 2" — it is noisy and non-standard.
