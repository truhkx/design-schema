# Generate: Divider for React (web)

You are generating a production component for the **Design Schema** design system. The component schema below is the source of truth. Do not invent props, events, or styles that are not in it, and do not omit any that are.

## Output

Write `packages/react/src/Divider.tsx` exporting a typed React function component named `Divider`, plus `Divider.stories.tsx` covering every enum value of every enum prop.

## Rules

- React 19: `ref` is a prop; no forwardRef; `useId`; Actions are not used by components. Type the component as `function Divider({ ref, …rest }: DividerProps & { ref?: Ref<HTMLElement> })` (the root element's type in place of `HTMLElement`) and attach `ref` to the root; generated ids come from `useId()`; never `useActionState`, `useFormStatus`, or a form `action` prop.
- Render the element and attributes declared under `platforms.web`. Map each event to its `platforms.web` name.
- Style ONLY through the CSS custom properties generated from tokens (`--color-…`, `--space-…`, `--font-…`, `--radius-…`). Never hard-code a color, size, or font. A style binding like `color.action.{variant}.background` becomes `var(--color-action-${variant}-background)`.
- Implement every item in `a11y.requires`:
  - `accessible-name`: the `label` prop is rendered as visible text or `aria-label`; never both empty.
  - `focus-visible`: a `:focus-visible` outline using `--color-border-focus` and `--border-width-focus`. Never remove the outline without replacing it.
  - `keyboard-operable`: native element semantics (do not build interactive elements from `<div>`).
  - `target-24px` / `target-44px`: `min-inline-size`/`min-block-size` from `--size-target-min` / `--size-target-comfortable`.
  - `heading-hierarchy`: render the heading level as the matching `<h1>`–`<h6>`; do not pick the element by visual size.
- `disabled` uses `aria-disabled="true"` and keeps the element focusable (WCAG-friendly) unless the schema says otherwise. On native checkable inputs (checkbox, radio, switch) `readOnly` has no effect, so guard with `preventDefault()` in both `click` and `change`.
- Visually hidden text (for accessible-name suffixes) uses the standard clip pattern — absolute, 1px box, `clip-path: inset(50%)`, `white-space: nowrap` — the one sanctioned use of pixel literals.
- Support light and dark by relying on the token variables only — no theme logic in the component.
- `disabled` uses `opacity.disabled`; transitions use `motion.duration.fast` + `motion.easing.standard` and are removed under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Use every `copy.*` string verbatim; do not write your own user-facing text.
- Testability hooks for the gates: the component root carries `data-ds="<Name>"`; a component with a `keyboard` block ships a story exported as `Keyboard` that renders it open/present with its trigger (if any) and at least three focusable children, no decorators that add other focusable elements.
- `keyboard` rules are the keyboard model: implement every key → action exactly as listed and nothing else; `composition` parts must render the named system component. Overlays: render into a portal at `document.body` (a `container` prop may override), lock body scroll while open, make the rest of the page `inert` for modal dialogs (`focus-trap` + `inert-background`), restore focus to the opener on close (`focus-restore`), position non-modal popups with `position: fixed` from the trigger's `getBoundingClientRect()` and flip when they would overflow the viewport, and put them on the right stacking layer with `z-index: var(--layer-<name>)`.
- Props of type `array`, `object`, or `function` carry a `shape` string in TypeScript notation; use it verbatim as the type. Prop type `content` is `ReactNode` / a slot / `ReactNode` by platform.
- Interpolated style bindings (`color.status.{tone}.background`) resolve per enum value at render time; never enumerate them by hand where a lookup will do. A resolved path ending in `.default` drops that segment (`color.background.{surface}` with `default` is `color.background`, i.e. `--color-background` / `colorBackground`); an enum value of `none` for a background/border/max-width binding renders nothing rather than a token.
- Composite components (Breadcrumb, Alert, RadioGroup) reuse the system's existing components (Link, Button, Text) from the same package rather than re-implementing them, and never restyle a child (no class overrides, no `::part`, no style props reaching into it): if a child needs a variation, the child's schema grows.
- Transitions use the component's own `transition` binding (its token and description), with `motion.easing.standard`; `motion.duration.fast` is only the default when a component has no `transition` binding.
- Development-only warnings the docs ask for use the platform convention: `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'` (React), `import.meta.env.DEV` (Lit), `__DEV__` (React Native).
- Stories are named after the prop and value in PascalCase (`ToneInfo`, `RoleBanner`); demo stories are titled `Demo/<Name>/<Platform>`.
- Icons: use the system `Icon` component for every glyph the docs name (`<Icon name="external" inline />`, `<ds-icon name="close">`, `<Icon name="check" color={…} />`); never draw an inline SVG or a Unicode glyph by hand. Decorative icons take no label; a glyph that carries meaning gets one.
- Enum props whose values are quoted digits (Heading `level`, Stack `gap`) accept both the string and the number.
- Stories: Storybook 10 CSF3 with `@storybook/react-vite`; title `'<Name>/React'`; one story per enum value plus Default.
- TypeScript 7 with `isolatedDeclarations`: every exported symbol carries an explicit type annotation and no export type is inferred — the component returns `ReactElement` (`ReactElement | null` when it can render nothing), exported constants, contexts and helpers are annotated, and `const meta: Meta<typeof Divider> = …` in stories. `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` (`name?: T | undefined`), `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and `verbatimModuleSyntax` (`import type`) are on.
- Tests run on Vitest 5 over Vite 8 (jsdom, `@testing-library/react`); the behavior scenarios below become `Divider.test.tsx`.
- Add a short JSDoc block that includes the "When to use" guidance verbatim.

## Component schema

```yaml
component:
  name: Divider
  category: layout
  status: review

    label:
      type: string
      description: 'Optional text in the middle of a horizontal divider ("or", "Earlier
        today"). Turns the divider from decorative into a labelled separator (`semantic`
        is implied). Ignored on a vertical divider, with a development warning: a
        vertical line has no room for centered text.'
    semantic:
      type: boolean
      default: false
      description: Expose as a separator to assistive technology. Leave false for
        purely visual lines between list rows; set true (or provide a label) when
        the divider marks a real boundary between sections that a screen-reader user
        should hear.
      a11y: false → aria-hidden / hidden from AT; true → role=separator with aria-orientation.

    swiftui:

      props:
      - Rectangle
      - .frame=height-1
      - .accessibilityHidden

      notes: A `Rectangle` of the color token, `border.width.thin` thick along the
        cross axis (`.frame(height:)` horizontal, `.frame(width:)` vertical), `.accessibilityHidden(true)`
        when decorative. With `label` the divider is an `HStack` of line–`Text`–line
        and is an accessibility element with that label (VoiceOver reads it as a section
        break); the label Text takes `fontSize` through `overrides`. Not SwiftUI's
        `Divider` (fixed color).
```

## Overrides (per-instance styling contract)

Every style binding above becomes a CSS custom-property hook on the component root, named `--ds-<component>-<binding>` (kebab-case), defaulting to its token: `.ds-button {{ --ds-button-padding-inline: var(--space-md); padding-inline: var(--ds-button-padding-inline); }}`. Interpolated bindings set the hook per modifier class (`.ds-button--primary {{ --ds-button-background: var(--color-action-primary-background) }}`). Rules always read the hook, never the token directly.

The component accepts `overrides?: Partial<Record<OverridableBinding, TokenRef>>` where `OverridableBinding` is the union of the overridable bindings below and `TokenRef` is the token-name union exported by `@design-schema/tokens` (`import type {{ TokenRef }} from '@design-schema/tokens'`). Each entry sets the hook inline as `var(--<token-kebab>)`. Locked bindings are not in the type and are ignored if passed. Consumers may also set the hooks from their own CSS; that is the sanctioned escape hatch and the docs say so.

Overrides change values, never presence: a prop that turns a part off (`surface: none`, `border: false`, `radius: none`) makes the matching overrides no-ops; apply an override only where the binding is in effect.

Overridable: `color`, `thickness`, `spacing`, `labelSize`, `labelGap`, `fontFamily`
Locked (accessibility-bearing, never overridable): `labelColor`

## Behavior scenarios (7)

Each scenario below becomes one test. They are platform-neutral: `given` are prop overrides on the `Default` story's args, `when` is one interaction, `then` is a list of expectations. Scenarios marked `derived` were produced by the parser from the schema; the rest were written in the doc. Render every scenario; never skip one because the component does not satisfy it. A scenario the code fails is a failing test, and a scenario that cannot be expressed on this platform is a gap to report, not a test to delete.

```yaml
- name: renders
  then:
  - renders: true
  derived: true
- name: renders-orientation-horizontal
  given:
    orientation: horizontal
  then:
  - renders: true
  derived: true
- name: renders-orientation-vertical
  given:
    orientation: vertical
  then:
  - renders: true
  derived: true
- name: renders-spacing-none
  given:
    spacing: none
  then:
  - renders: true
  derived: true

  derived: true
```

## Platform notes (web)

```yaml
element: hr
attributes:
- aria-hidden
- role=separator
- aria-orientation
notes: 'A decorative divider is <hr aria-hidden="true"> (hr has an implicit separator
  role, so hiding it is deliberate); a semantic or labelled one is <div role="separator"
  aria-orientation> containing the label text, because <hr> cannot hold content. Vertical:
  inline-size thin, block-size 100% / align-self stretch.'
```

## Guidance

## Overview

A divider is a line, and the question it always raises is whether the line means something. Between two rows of a list it is furniture: it helps the eye and says nothing. Between "Today" and "Earlier" it is structure a screen-reader user should hear. Divider makes that choice explicit instead of leaving it to whether someone remembered `aria-hidden`.

## When to use

Use a Divider between items in a dense list where whitespace alone does not separate them, between groups in a menu (Menu renders its own), between toolbar groups (`vertical`), and with a `label` as an "or" between alternatives (sign in with email — or — with a provider) or a date heading in a feed. Use `spacing` when the divider stands outside a Stack.

## When not to use

Do not use dividers between page sections; use `section` spacing and headings — a page full of rules is a page without rhythm. Do not use a divider under a heading as decoration. Do not use a labelled divider as a heading substitute; if the label introduces content, it is a Heading. Do not rely on a divider alone to separate interactive regions.

## Behavior

Renders a one-token-thick line in the border color along the chosen axis, with optional symmetric spacing. With `label`, the text is centered with a line on each side and the divider becomes semantic. Nothing is interactive.

## Content guidelines

Labels are one to three words, sentence case or lowercase for conjunctions ("or"), no punctuation. Date and group labels match the headings elsewhere on the screen.

## Accessibility

Decorative dividers are hidden from assistive technology so lists do not announce "separator" between every row (WCAG 1.3.1 — structure is conveyed by the list, not the line). Semantic dividers expose role `separator` with `aria-orientation`, and labelled ones read their text. The line is below the 3:1 non-text threshold on purpose — it is not required to identify anything (1.4.11 exemption), and the label, when present, meets 4.5:1.

## Platform notes

### Web
Decorative: `<hr aria-hidden="true" class="ds-divider">`. Semantic: `<div role="separator" aria-orientation={orientation}>` with, for a label, two flex-grow line spans around a `Text size="sm" tone="muted"`. Vertical uses `inline-size: var(--border-width-thin); align-self: stretch`.

### Lit
`<ds-divider>`; `<ds-divider semantic label="or">`. Host carries the styles and, when semantic, `internals.role = 'separator'` and `ariaOrientation`. The label renders in the shadow root.

### React Native
`View` with `height: t.borderWidthThin, backgroundColor: t.colorBorder` (or width for vertical, `alignSelf: 'stretch'`). Decorative: hidden from AT. Labelled: a row of two lines with a `Text` between; the text is what gets read.
