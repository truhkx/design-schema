# Generate: Landmark for SwiftUI (iOS)

You are generating a production component for the **Design Schema** design system. The component schema below is the source of truth. Do not invent props, events, or styles that are not in it, and do not omit any that are.

## Output

Write `packages/swiftui/Sources/DesignSchema/Landmark.swift` declaring `public struct Landmark: View` with a public initializer whose parameters are the schema's props **in the schema's order** (doc defaults as default arguments), then the event closures in the schema's order, then `overrides:`; nested `public enum`s for enum props (`String` raw values equal to the doc values, case names the values camel-cased — `icon-only` → `iconOnly` — with leading digits moved to the end, `2xl` → `xl2`, since nothing else is a Swift identifier); `public struct`s for `array`/`object` shapes named from the shape; closures for events named per `platforms.swiftui`; and `#Preview` blocks. That order and those names are a contract: `tools/behavior_tests.ts` writes `Tests/DesignSchemaTests/Generated/LandmarkBehaviorTests.swift` from the doc's `behavior` block and calls this initializer directly. Beside it write `packages/swiftui/Sources/DesignSchema/Gallery+Landmark.swift`: `public extension Gallery { static var <name>Screen: GalleryEntry { GalleryEntry("Landmark") { … } } }`, one gallery screen showing the component in its states, where `<name>Screen` is the component name with a lower-case first letter. Never edit `Support/Gallery+Generated.swift` — the generator rewrites that list from the screen files.

## Rules

- Render the SwiftUI view declared under `platforms.swiftui.element` with the modifiers listed under `platforms.swiftui.props`. Map each event to its `platforms.swiftui` name.
- Read tokens from `@Environment(\.dsTheme)` (`DesignSchemaTokens`). Colors are `Color`, dimensions `CGFloat` points, durations `TimeInterval`, easings `Animation`, font weights `Font.Weight`, line heights unitless multipliers. Never hard-code a color, size, font or duration. A style binding like `color.action.{variant}.background` becomes a lookup keyed by the enum value.
- Implement every item in `a11y.requires` with SwiftUI's accessibility API:
  - `accessible-name`: `.accessibilityLabel(label)`; a visually hidden label is still the label.
  - `keyboard-operable` / `focus-visible`: `.focusable()` where the doc's keyboard table applies, `@FocusState` for the roving index, `.dsOnKeyPress` (the package's own wrapper around `.onKeyPress(keys:)`, so the behavior gate can reach the same handler) / `.onMoveCommand` / `.onExitCommand` for the keys, and the focus ring drawn from `focusRing`/`focusRingWidth` only for keyboard focus.
  - `target-24px` / `target-44px`: `.frame(minWidth: theme.sizeTargetMin, minHeight: …)` (or `sizeTargetComfortable`) plus `.contentShape(Rectangle())`.
  - `heading-hierarchy`: `.accessibilityAddTraits(.isHeader)`; `.accessibilityHeading(.h1…h6)` from the level prop.
  - `live-region`: `AccessibilityNotification.Announcement`.
  - `reduced-motion`: `@Environment(\.accessibilityReduceMotion)` disables every animation the doc names.
  - `selected-state` / `expanded-state`: `.isSelected` trait or `.accessibilityValue("expanded"/"collapsed")`.
  - `gesture-alternative`: every gesture has a visible control and an `.accessibilityAction`.
- `disabled` uses `opacity.disabled` on the whole element, `.accessibilityRespondsToUserInteraction(false)` and a press guard; never `.disabled(true)` unless the doc says the control leaves the focus order.
- Controlled/uncontrolled pairs (`value`/`defaultValue`, `open`/`defaultOpen`) become a `Binding<T>?` parameter plus a `default` initial value, with `@State` holding the uncontrolled value.
- `content` props are `@ViewBuilder` generic closures. Enum props whose values are quoted digits (Heading `level`, Stack `gap`) accept `Int` as well.
- Use every `copy.*` string verbatim through `String(localized:)`-ready constants; do not write your own user-facing text.
- Testability hooks: `.accessibilityIdentifier("Landmark")` on the root and `"Landmark.<part>"` on every anatomy part, names verbatim. The generated behavior tests find everything through them and assert against the accessibility tree, so a state the doc names has to be visible there: `expanded` as `.accessibilityValue("expanded")`/`("collapsed")`, `selected` as `.isSelected`, `disabled` as an element that reports itself not enabled.
- `keyboard` rules describe the web keyboard model; implement the subset an iPad hardware keyboard can reach and expose everything else through accessibility actions and visible controls. Overlays follow the conventions (sheet / fullScreenCover / popover / confirmationDialog / Menu).
- Props of type `array`, `object`, or `function` carry a `shape` string in TypeScript notation; translate it to a Swift `struct`/closure type with the same member names. `ReactNode` is a `@ViewBuilder` closure or `AnyView`.
- Interpolated style bindings (`color.status.{tone}.background`) resolve per enum value at render time; a resolved path ending in `.default` drops that segment; an enum value of `none` for a background/border/max-width binding renders nothing rather than a token.
- Composite components reuse the system's existing views (`Button`, `Link`, `Text`, `Heading`, `Icon`, `Stack`) from the package rather than re-implementing them, and never restyle a child: if a child needs a variation, the child's schema grows.
- Transitions use the component's own `transition` binding with `motion.easing.standard`; `motion.duration.fast` is only the default when a component has no `transition` binding.
- Development-only warnings use `#if DEBUG`.
- Previews are named after the prop and value in PascalCase (`ToneInfo`, `RoleBanner`).
- Icons: use `Icon(name:)` for every glyph the docs name; never draw a glyph inline and never use SF Symbols.
- Swift 6 strict concurrency: value-type views, `@MainActor` only around UIKit calls, no `@unchecked Sendable`.

        (attribute `role`) because `role` already exists on HTMLElement. With no shadow
        root there is no static styles; set `display: block` inline in connectedCallback

        renders the semantic element; on native it maps to the nearest accessibilityRole
        or none. Exception: RN''s `Role` union has no `search` landmark (only the
        `searchbox` widget), so `search` is passed as the legacy accessibilityRole="search",
        which react-native-web maps to the ARIA search landmark; iOS and Android have
        no equivalent, so it is web-parity only. The label is applied as accessibilityLabel
        only for `region`, `form`, and `navigation`, so screen readers get a group
        name without every View announcing a role.'

        the region boundary when entering it, and registers an `.accessibilityRotorEntry`

        only when the doc asks. The element name (`nav`, `aside`) has no equivalent;
        `role` drives everything.'
```

## Overrides (per-instance styling contract)

The component accepts `overrides: [Binding: TokenRef] = [:]` where `Binding` is a nested `public enum Binding: String, CaseIterable` listing the overridable bindings below and `TokenRef` is the token-name enum generated into `DesignSchemaTokens`. Resolve each entry with `theme[ref]` and use the typed result in place of the binding's default token. This is the ONLY per-instance styling surface: there is no style modifier parameter, so a screen cannot drift from the system by passing points. Locked bindings are not cases of `Binding`.

Overrides change values, never presence: a prop that turns a part off (`surface: none`, `border: false`, `radius: none`) makes the matching overrides no-ops; apply an override only where the binding is in effect.

Overridable: none
Locked (accessibility-bearing, never overridable): none

## Guidance

## Overview

Landmarks are the page's table of contents for assistive technology. A screen-reader user arriving on a page presses one key to jump to the main content, another to list the navigations, another for the search. Without landmarks they read from the top. This component exists so that every page in the system gets the same, correct set of them without anyone remembering which element implies which role.

## When to use

Wrap the page's major regions in a Landmark: one `banner` for the site header, one `main` for the primary content, `navigation` for each navigation block (labelled when there is more than one), `complementary` for sidebars that make sense on their own, `contentinfo` for the site footer, `search` around the site search form, and `region` for any other section a user might want to jump to — a "Related articles" block, a dashboard panel. Every page should have exactly one `main`.

## When not to use

Do not wrap everything: a page with twenty landmarks is as hard to navigate as one with none. Layout containers, cards, list items and form groups are not landmarks; use Stack, Fieldset (planned), or nothing. Do not use `region` without a `label` — an unlabelled region is not exposed as a landmark and the component will warn. Do not use Landmark to style a region; it has no visual bindings by design.

## Behavior

Landmark renders its children inside the appropriate element with the appropriate role and name, and nothing else: no padding, background, or layout. It is transparent to layout on every platform (`display: contents` is *not* used, because it removes the element's semantics in some browsers; instead the element is a plain block and consumers lay it out like any block). In development, the component warns when `main` appears more than once in a document, when `region` or `form` has no `label`, and when two `navigation`, `complementary`, `region` or `form` landmarks in the same root share a label or both lack one (`banner`, `main` and `contentinfo` never take labels). On native there is no document to scan, so only the missing-label warning applies.

## Content guidelines

Labels name the region in one or two words and do not repeat the role: "Main" and "Footer" for two navigations (read as "Main navigation"), not "Main navigation menu". Labels are sentence case and never punctuated. Where the region already starts with a visible heading, the label should match the heading text.

## Accessibility

Landmark regions let users bypass blocks and understand page structure (WCAG 1.3.1, 2.4.1). Each region has a role from the ARIA landmark set, and a name when the role appears more than once or when the role is `region` or `form`, which are landmarks only when named (4.1.2). Exactly one `main` per document. Native HTML elements are used wherever they imply the role, so no ARIA is added where the element already provides it, in line with the first rule of ARIA. Nested landmarks are allowed only where the APG allows them: a `navigation` inside `banner` is fine; a `main` inside anything is not.

## Platform notes

### Web
Choose the element from `role` unless `as` is set: `banner`→`<header role="banner">`, `navigation`→`<nav>`, `main`→`<main>`, `complementary`→`<aside>`, `contentinfo`→`<footer role="contentinfo">`, `region`→`<section aria-label>`, `search`→`<form role="search">`, `form`→`<form aria-label>`. Always emit `role` on `header` and `footer` and whenever `as` overrides the default element; never branch on `document` at render time (SSR). Apply `aria-label` from `label`. The forwarded ref is typed `HTMLElement` (not the specific element chosen by `as`), so render through `createElement` with `HTMLAttributes<HTMLElement>` rather than a union of intrinsic tags. Development warnings use `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'`.

### Lit
`<ds-landmark role="navigation" label="Main">` uses no shadow root. The property is `landmark` (attribute `role`). In `connectedCallback`, attach `ElementInternals`, set `internals.role` and `internals.ariaLabel`, and set `display: block` inline when unset, so the host element itself is the landmark and its light-DOM children are its content. Warnings are logged in development builds only (`import.meta.env.DEV`; the package tsconfig includes `vite/client` types).

### React Native
Render a `View` with the `role` prop (which react-native-web turns into the semantic element and iOS/Android map to the nearest accessibility role or ignore), and `accessibilityLabel={label}` for `navigation`, `region` and `form` so the group has a name for TalkBack and VoiceOver. Do not set `accessible={true}` on the container; it would collapse every child into one element. There is no jump-to-landmark on native — the value here is web parity and a consistent structure for the same screen code.
